# Leaders Create the Optimal Environment for People to Thrive



Leadership skills are critically important to our business. At Schroders, our leaders create the optimal environment for people to thrive.

- They motivate teams and inspire them to achieve the best possible outcomes.

- They create the capacity and give confidence to our colleagues to experiment and learn.

- They provide an anchor to the strategic objectives of the organisation while listening for and responding to systemic issues.

> "Leadership is not defined by the exercise of power but by the capacity to increase the sense of power among those led. The most essential work of the leader is to create more leaders."

> \- Mary Parker Follett

They [**lead by example**](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/671f032e-918e-4864-a9ce-17b0e06e61d5.aspx), setting the quality bar high and taking the time to learn and refine the same good practices and ways of working used by the agile delivery teams.

For example, we expect our teams to regularly retrospect, looking at the work they've done, what's gone well, and where improvements can be made, so should each of our leaders, communicating and sharing the insight they have gained.

## Optimal Environment for People to Thrive

As a leader within Schroders, you should regularly take the stance of a servant-leader. Servant-leaders focus on the growth and well-being of people and the communities to which they belong.

Contrasting this with traditional leadership, where it generally involves the accumulation and exercise of power by ones at the "top of the pyramid," servant leadership is different. The servant-leader shares power, puts the needs of others first, and helps people develop and perform as highly as possible.

## Capacity and Confidence to Experiment and Learn

At the heart of every new feature or product is that 'one great idea'. Unfortunately, not every great idea is actually great. In the early stages of development or design, it's hard to distinguish good ideas from the not-so-good ones. This is where the idea of failing fast becomes beneficial, iterating fast on failures helps us achieve a desired result faster than perfecting the wrong ideas to begin with.

Leaders should ensure that there is capacity built into delivery timeframes for teams to experiment with prototypes and different solutions, enabling them to 'fail fast'. You should tolerate and embrace failure as a necessary input to radical innovation. This means giving moderate (not too hard or too easy) challenges employees need to work through and give teams the confidence to work this way.

## Anchor to the Strategic Objectives

When trying to understand the key strategic aims of our organisation, leaders are often looked to as a key source of information. It's therefore important to clearly translate and communicate these in such a way that allows employees to understand why each is a priority, how it will be measured, and how the work they are doing contributes to them. Being clear with your messaging builds awareness, garners curiosity, and prompts discussion and innovation.

We have covered this topic in more detail in the ['**Understanding How Our Work Contributes to Our Overall Purpose**](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/f5a15f2e-81de-4ec6-b29f-920bccd23e46.aspx)' pattern.

## Responding to Systemic Issues

Occasionally teams come up against problems and issues that are impossible to resolve themselves. Regularly, these problems are human-derived and may have multiple levels, systems, or groups of other people and will require different techniques than the ones used to solve simple or even complicated problems. As a leader with Schroders, we do our best to resolve these so teams can do the best work possible.

We have covered this topic in detail in the ['**Recognising & Tackling Systemic Impediments**](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/ID6VBaZIXQPTWxMkPM5uw/14c1a8d6-9ad4-49ab-a0ec-e9504707cf21.aspx)' pattern.

## Our Expectations of You

As a leader of people, we also have a series of expectations that you should be demonstrating. These include the following behaviours:

- Nurturers and exporters of talent

- Embracing a change mindset

- Role models of collaboration

- Translators of strategy

- Facilitators of high-performing teams

- Enablers of inclusion & diversity
