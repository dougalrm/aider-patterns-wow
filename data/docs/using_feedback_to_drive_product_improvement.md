# Using Feedback to Drive Product Improvement



"***I love the feedback cycle. It\'s all about taking feedback, considering it, and using it to make our product even better. It\'s really important to me because it helps me make sure I\'m always on top of what our customers and users need and want."***

Feedback is a crucial part of the agile development process, as it helps teams grow and create better products by [**continuously improving** (opens new browser tab)](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/d88bc27f-dd37-4d04-878e-c46efea9d098.aspx). When combined with open and honest communication, it ensures everyone is on the same page about what needs improvement.

By giving and receiving feedback regularly, teams can quickly spot and solve issues, leading to better efficiency and higher-quality results, giving a better experience to users and boosting customer satisfaction.

This article covers using the feedback cycle, why it's important to get regular feedback, several methods for gathering feedback, and who you should be getting feedback from.

## The Feedback Cycle

![Image showing the feedback cycle of Gather insight, analyse, make improvements and follow up.](Using%20feedback%20to%20drive%20product%20improvement_media/media/image2.png)

The feedback cycle is an essential part of our efforts to provide the best possible experience for our customers and users. It\'s about taking their feedback, evaluating it, and using it to make improvements.

The feedback cycle starts with collecting feedback from a range of stakeholders, including customers, users, and team members. Input can come in various forms: surveys, user testing, support tickets, or face-to-face interactions. The feedback is then organized, analyzed, prioritized, and utilized to inform what we do next.

Based on this, we can make improvements and the cycle begins again. The continuous process of receiving and incorporating feedback helps us to stay ahead of the game, remain relevant, and continually improve our offerings.

## Why is it Important to Get Regular Feedback?

Regular feedback is vital for making sure the product satisfies customer and user needs and expectations, and is also essential for maintaining and improving product quality. By receiving feedback, teams can quickly detect and resolve issues before they become major problems. Feedback also validates assumptions about the product or process and helps to uncover new opportunities.

### Regular Feedback can be Used to:

- **Improve the product**: Feedback is critical for making a good product great. It helps us pinpoint weaknesses and drive improvements. Feedback from the team also provides a fresh perspective, leading to even more ways to enhance the product.

- **Streamline the process**: Feedback has a big impact on the product development process. By considering feedback on communication, collaboration, and efficiency, we can streamline the process and create a smoother, more effective development experience.

- **Boost engineering & quality**: Feedback drives improvement in engineering, leading to higher quality outcomes. By incorporating feedback on readability, maintainability, and scalability of code, we can improve our engineering efforts and deliver top-notch results.

- **Foster team unity & performance**: Feedback is vital for building strong team relationships and collaboration. It\'s important to create a [**positive environment** (opens new browser tab)](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/aa3752ff-4edf-4889-a690-516f1cd2755c.aspx) where team members feel comfortable giving and receiving feedback, and where constructive criticism is not only accepted but also encouraged.

## Methods for Getting Regular, Reliable, Timely, and Constructive Feedback

There are several methods for getting feedback within an agile team, including:

### Interviews

Interviews are a more in-depth method of gathering feedback. They can be conducted in person, over the phone, or through video conferencing. Interviews allow teams to gather detailed feedback on specific topics and can provide valuable insights into user or customer needs.

For inspiration, check out the following article from Roadmunk: [**'How to find the best features to build using the right customer interview questions' (opens new browser tab)](https://roadmunk.com/guides/customer-interview-questions-product-management/).

### Surveys

Surveys are a great way to gather feedback from a large number of users or customers. Surveys can be conducted online or in person, and can be designed to gather feedback on a wide range of topics, such as product satisfaction, usability, and user experience.

Check out the following Product Alpaca article about what a good survey-led approach looks like: [**'Surveys: when should you use them, and when to pass' (opens new browser tab)](https://medium.com/design-warp/surveys-when-should-you-use-them-and-when-to-pass-ac2a6ba81a01).

### Usability Testing

Usability testing is a method of gathering feedback by observing users as they interact with a product. This can be done in person or remotely. Usability testing allows teams to identify usability issues and gather feedback on how users interact with the product.

### Code Reviews

Code reviews are an effective way to gather feedback on the quality of the code. Team members provide feedback on the readability, maintainability, and scalability of the code.

Check out the following Git Lab article covering [**'What are code reviews, and how do they work?' (opens new browser tab)](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/version-control/what-is-code-review/).

Peer review is also one of our mandatory ways of working. [**Software must be peer reviewed prior to deployment into a production environment' (opens new browser tab)](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/7SSZvpCu3cfjiRlAaYeoAw/050f55eb-23d4-4ea4-ab75-452a1ef082c7.aspx).

### Pairing

Pairing, where two people work together on a single task, enables constant feedback and collaboration between the individuals, leading to faster development and an increased understanding of the task at hand. Receiving feedback on ideas and approaches helps team members see where they can improve, develop new skills, and think about tasks in a different way.

### Retrospectives

Regular retrospectives are an effective way to gather feedback on the process of developing a product. Team members can provide feedback on the process and identify areas that can be improved.

Check out the [**'Inspect & adapt to continuously improve (Retrospectives)' (opens new browser tab)](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/11323923-036e-4eb7-9d15-12856e7b2a0b.aspx) pattern.

### Performance Reviews

Performance reviews are a formal method of gathering feedback on an individual\'s work. These reviews can be done regularly and can provide feedback on areas of improvement, as well as recognizing achievements.

### Open Communication

Encourage open and transparent communication among team members and create an environment where team members feel comfortable giving and receiving feedback, and where constructive criticism is encouraged.

## Who Should be Involved in Feedback?

For effective and well-rounded feedback, it\'s crucial to involve different stakeholders in the evaluation process. The following groups of people should be involved in feedback:

- **Customers or users**: Their feedback is central as they are the ones using the product, platform, or service, and can provide valuable insights into usability and user experience.

- **Team members**: Team members have hands-on experience with the product, and their feedback can provide valuable insights into the process and quality.

- **Management**: Management's involvement is important to make well-informed decisions and drive improvement at a wider/larger scale.

- **External experts**: External experts, those not in the team, bring a fresh perspective and can provide valuable feedback on the product.

## Wrapping Up

In conclusion, feedback is a much-needed component of the agile development process. By promoting open and honest communication, feedback allows teams to continuously improve their work, resolve issues, and align with each other. Whether through regular check-ins, peer reviews, or retrospectives, incorporating feedback into the development process results in a culture of collaboration, growth, and better outcomes.

Teams must prioritize and encourage feedback to ensure it is timely, reliable, and actionable. With the right approach, feedback can help teams identify and address issues early on, validate assumptions, improve the user experience, and drive personal development.
