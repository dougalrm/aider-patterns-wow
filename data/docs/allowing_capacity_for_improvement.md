title: Allowing capacity for improvement

description: Balancing business outcomes with improvement is essential for agile success. This involves ensuring sprint backlogs aren't overloaded and capacity isn't solely filled with new features, allowing time for team improvement, tackling technical debt, and fostering innovation. Prioritizing a sustainable pace prevents burnout and encourages high-performing, adaptable teams.

# Allowing Capacity for Improvement (CDF Pattern)



To be the most effective we can be, we must strike the right balance between dedicating time to achieving our business outcomes and dedicating time to improving our ability to do so. Improvement in this sense covers two things:

1. **The ability of the team to change and improve the way it works**

2. **The ability of the team to tackle things that will improve its products that aren't necessarily new features**

The first Agile Principle from the Agile Manifesto is *"Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software"*. In a modern context, the word "software" can be replaced with "products," but the emphasis remains relevant even today -- 20+ years after it was written.

A [**regular cadence**](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/dc7c0b13-1a7a-4646-ab14-e41cf6792d17.aspx) of putting actual working products into customers' hands is at the heart of agile ways of working, as it allows immediate feedback from those whose needs you're trying to satisfy. However, there's a need to balance the continuous delivery of valuable products with the needs that enable teams to become and remain high-performing and to maintain high-quality products.

An example of the former may include improving how the team understands and gathers requirements, whereas the latter involves prioritizing the reduction of technical debt over developing a new feature.

In environments where the mindset is that the Technology function is simply a "[**feature factory**](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/12-signs-youre-working-in-a-feature-factory-44a5b938d6a2)", there's typically pressure to push for the delivery of more features at the expense of staying on top of technical debt or [**continuous improvement**](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/11323923-036e-4eb7-9d15-12856e7b2a0b.aspx).

Eventually, this leads to very long lead times for features and often-significant rewrites of the codebase. [**This is closely related to capacity and queue length (the time it takes to get work over the line)**](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/8f28ec5a-7b86-4fbc-bdf4-9d61c142d1bf.aspx).

The Navy SEALs have a saying that emphasizes the need to get this balance right: "Slow is smooth and smooth is fast." When we push to go too fast and do too much, it causes mistakes and results in slower (and riskier) performance than following a measured, methodical cadence.

## Getting the Balance Right

We need to ensure there is sufficient capacity planned into roadmaps, backlogs, and sprints to enable our teams to get this balance right. This means:

- Sprint Backlogs are not 100% filled.

- We do not fill capacity purely with new features but consider other work types, including team improvement activities.

- [**Retrospectives and other improvement activities**](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/11323923-036e-4eb7-9d15-12856e7b2a0b.aspx) are not routinely deprioritized.

- Teams stay on top of technical debt. (It's a good idea to have some measure of this).

- Additional time is factored in for inevitable unknowns.

- Time for personal development is recognized, supported, and protected within business hours.

- Teams have time to experiment and innovate, ideally with regular collaboration with business stakeholders.

- Buffer time is an accepted and valuable allocation of some of the team's capacity.

Creating such an environment also requires recognizing and rewarding teams for getting this balance right, and sharing what they have learned.

Naturally, there will be times when the balance needs to favor meeting important strategic deadlines, but these shorter-term pressures must be balanced out to enable high-performing teams.

This balance can be maintained over various horizons (days, sprints, months, or quarters), but the preference would be a smaller time horizon to avoid flipping between months of new value development and months of addressing tech debt.

## What Happens When We Don't Get This Balance Right?

It's observed that teams and stakeholders fill their roadmaps and sprints to or beyond 100% capacity for various best-intentioned reasons. This might occur due to the inability to say no to work, difficulties in prioritizing based on data, or a lack of understanding of the impact of 'pushing harder' to 'do more'. Although this gives the illusion of accomplishing more, it doesn't allow time for the team to refine and automate processes, ultimately compromising long-term effectiveness.

Regularly working this way and planning to maximum capacity puts a huge burden on teams and likely means they cannot maintain that pace indefinitely, leading to burnout, high turnover, and an inability to do creative problem-solving.

## Further Insight

In this [**AgileFellow article**](https://agilefellow.com/category/agile-planning/) the topic is introduced with some math to illustrate the importance of allowing time for other activities, showing that this concept equally applies to improvement activities.

In this [**Mountain Goat Software article**](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/why-i-prefer-capacity-driven-sprint-planning) Mike Cohn discusses the differences between capacity-driven and velocity-driven sprint planning and the reasons one may be preferred over the other.
