# Beyond PI Planning: Moving to Shorter Planning Horizons to Deliver Greater Value (CDF)

![A beach with waves crashing on the shore Description automatically generated](Beyond%20PI%20Planning_media/media/image1.jpeg)



To continuously improve the way we deliver value to our business, we are changing the way we work and moving to shorter planning horizons. This article describes why we're replacing PI Planning, what we are replacing it with, and how to make the transition.

## Our Plan for Enhancing Our Ways of Working

Schroders introduced Agile ways of working in 2016 through the implementation of SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework). Our goal is to build upon the foundation laid by SAFe and further enhance our ways of working. This is a key part of the Global Technology strategy.

## Why We're Recommending Replacing PI Planning & Moving to Shorter Planning Horizons

PI Planning is a key event in the SAFe framework. It is a two-day event that typically takes place every 8-12 weeks, during which all members of an Agile Release Train (ART) come together to plan and coordinate their work for the upcoming Program Increment (PI).

However, some criticism of PI Planning is that it's time-consuming and process-heavy. It's also harder to adapt to changing priorities and requirements, and teams often need to re-plan their work as more information becomes available.

By moving to shorter planning horizons, we can:

- Respond more quickly to changing circumstances

- Reduce the risk of wasted effort

- Improve our overall efficiency

## What We're Replacing PI Planning With

We are now recommending that teams plan on a continuous basis, giving high levels of confidence to the immediate, the next 2 weeks, and an appropriate level of confidence as time is further out.

This change will involve more frequent planning than the previous approach but without the same time commitments. As an interim step, you may wish to consider planning every 4 to 6 weeks, and then more often as you mature your ways of working.

## How to Make the Transition

Teams should continue their normal scrum events but introduce or develop regular refinement sessions. In a refinement session, ideas for features are generated, reviewed, evaluated, and prioritized.

Prioritized features on the team's backlog are broken down into stories and refined until they meet the team's [criteria for being ready to work on](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/7b41446b-109e-4460-99ac-37ce8c62dd91.aspx). Teams should aim to have enough stories that are ready to work on for the current and subsequent sprint.

Features are planned using a [delivery plan](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/CIWsscu83QKHLo3NKRvg/530254f9-8222-4bb6-a35c-10b41f5dd835.aspx). A delivery plan plots features on a timeline and helps to facilitate discussions on a teamâ€™s capacity to complete work, sequencing, and dependency management. It also provides visibility of progress and confidence levels to stakeholders. Features are aligned to outcomes, and multiple features may be needed to achieve an outcome.

A [roadmap](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/ZnItogF7IpiI2HA9asSMiA/4e2e7b9c-34de-41ac-9241-f02c2704d523.aspx) helps communicate how an area aims to achieve its strategic objectives or vision. It expresses the work as outcomes and organizes them into three priority-based time horizons: Now, Next, and Later, starting with the most important problems to solve or opportunities to capitalize on.

| Time Horizon | Artefact & Usage |

|--------------|------------------|

| 1-3 years | Start with **long-term strategic objectives that support your vision**. We recommend writing this down and saving it somewhere central so that everyone has access to it. |

| [Now, Next, Later](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/ZnItogF7IpiI2HA9asSMiA/4e2e7b9c-34de-41ac-9241-f02c2704d523.aspx) | Use a [**roadmap**](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/ZnItogF7IpiI2HA9asSMiA/4e2e7b9c-34de-41ac-9241-f02c2704d523.aspx) to help communicate the plan to achieve these objectives and vision. Outcomes describe the problems to solve from the client's perspective that will help move us towards achieving these. |

| [Approx. 4-6 weeks](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/CIWsscu83QKHLo3NKRvg/530254f9-8222-4bb6-a35c-10b41f5dd835.aspx) | Communicate the features that will achieve the outcomes in a [**delivery plan**](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/CIWsscu83QKHLo3NKRvg/530254f9-8222-4bb6-a35c-10b41f5dd835.aspx). |

| Approx. 2-4 weeks | Continue to use **scrum events and regular refinement sessions** to refine features and stories so they're ready to work on. |
