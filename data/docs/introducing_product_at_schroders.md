# Introducing Product at Schroders (CDF)

Building the right thing, and building the thing right. Product at Schroders.



## Product at Schroders Today

Today at Schroders, our business and technology functions operate together to deliver valuable products and platforms that support the needs of clients. Currently, supporting the development of these products are Capability Owners, Capability Leads, and Capability Managers. However, there is a lack of consistency and clarity across these roles, and the way in which they work varies significantly.

## Evolving Product at Schroders

We are introducing a product capability at Schroders to help cement the partnership between technology and the business. This will also bring us in line with other businesses.

A product capability will improve our products and platforms, helping to ensure we are ***building the right thing, and building the thing right***.

As part of the work we're doing to improve our ways of working, we are defining consistent roles across the firm, and one of these will be the new role of Product Lead (PL).

## The New Role of Product Lead

The Product Lead (PL) will focus on identifying and evaluating needs, opportunities, and problems that help the business innovate, mitigate risk, and provide a return on investment.

A key part of the Product Lead role will be to foster a strong partnership between Global Technology (GT), Business, and Operational functions, and work closely with them.

Product Leads will be accountable for defining 'what' is being delivered, with the business responsible for providing the 'why'. They will act as the voice of the customer throughout the development cycle, leaving delivery teams to figure out 'how' to solve customer problems or capitalize on opportunities.

Product Leads will work as part of a delivery team. As the diagram below shows, they'll work closely with the Delivery Lead (DL) and Engineering Lead (EL). This will ensure the 'what' and the 'why' are understood alongside the 'how' and the 'when'.

Product Leads will also use their specific business domain knowledge and insight to refine and prioritize the Product Backlog in conjunction with business sponsors, ensuring teams have clarity to deliver the right thing at the right time.

The Product Lead position will be a dedicated role, not a hat someone wears while performing another role within Schroders.

While the core responsibilities of all Product Leads will be the same, the area and context they work in will differ, necessitating different skills, experience, and support.

Product Leads are invited to collaborate with and contribute to the Product Community of Practice (CoP). This will help define and establish good practices, develop skills, allow sharing of experiences, and help new product people to get the support they need.

In some instances, Product Leads may be highly technical and support teams that deliver products for other technology teams. Where products are closely aligned, or Product Leads are suitably experienced, they may support more than one delivery team.

We've developed a [**Product Lead job description**](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/EnterpriseSoftwareDelivery/Ed4jxQKfmuJFnLemNekSbPIBWWRAkcl-9f40AslDOrh3VQ) which covers the main responsibilities of the role and a [**Product Lead-focused RACI**](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/EnterpriseSoftwareDelivery/EXqGduXLDL5Nhrlj-JtW1KwBI0p7Dsh5pBU41CmpdPDvPw) to help explain the interactions between roles including Delivery Leads, Engineering Leads, Business Owners, and Senior Stakeholders.

*(R - Responsible, Person who performs an activity or does the work. A - Accountable, Person who is ultimately accountable and has the yes / no / veto. C - Consulted, Person that needs to feedback and contribute to the activity. I - Informed, Person that needs to know of the decision or action.)*

## The Product Lens

Those in the Product Lead role will need to think about factors such as:

- **Viability**: Can we earn enough money from the idea? i.e., Are operating costs too high? Will there be sufficient return on investment? Is the user base big enough?

- **Desirability**: Are customers interested in the idea? i.e., Does it meet a genuine need?

- **Feasibility**: Do we have the skills and/or resources to build and maintain it?

## Moving to Product from a Project Mindset

Introducing product to an organization is more than introducing new roles; it requires a mindset change and a major change in ways of working, from funding through to org shape and down to metrics and processes.

A project to product mini series has been created around a key infographic that helps us better understand how we can all influence and assist in landing product at Schroders.
