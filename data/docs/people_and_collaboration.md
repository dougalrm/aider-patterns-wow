# People & Collaboration (CDF Principle)



## Our Five Ways of Working Principles

1. **People & Collaboration**

2. Leading by Example

3. Clear Business Outcomes

4. Stable, Empowered Teams

5. Continuous Improvement

Our principles are rooted in agile values and principles. Here we take each principle in turn and explore what it means. It's worth remembering that these are aspirational concepts that describe the place we want to get to.

## Intro

To succeed in [achieving our outcomes](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/YASyWyZ006UdMmjiDSgqSQ/481855c1-f699-480e-8805-cea97f7b0939.aspx) we need an organization that values its people, their contribution, and their opinions and one which enables and empowers everyone. Empowered organizations create value more quickly, collaboratively, and effectively than a siloed and highly managed one. They also create much more valuable products and achieve better business outcomes.

## Principle: People & Collaboration

We value People & Collaboration. This means:

- Roles are clear and have defined competency frameworks.

- Career progression options are clear.

- People are supported.

- Team members share knowledge and gain new skills.

- Teams work effectively and collaborate and communicate well with other teams.

- We have the right tools to support collaboration and provide clarity.

- We talk about "our business" and work in a strong partnership.

## Where Are We Heading?

People & Collaboration comes from a desire to improve in several areas. The 'From' statements below describe where some of us are today (you might recognize these), while the 'To' statements describe where we want to get to in the future. Below we have expanded on each of these to give more insight.

| **From** | **To** |

|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Confusion on Roles and Responsibility | Clarity on Roles and Responsibility |

| Struggling to stay afloat | Experience, training, and support |

| Lack of career transparency | Career frameworks and growth opportunities |

| Hand-offs and inconsistency are commonplace | T-shaping, and self-service reduce delays |

| Organizational knowledge has a high barrier to entry | Knowledge sharing, Mentoring and Buddying, and Communities of Practice fill the gaps |

| Poor tooling hampers collaboration | Tools that support collaboration and provide clarity |

| Divides in our organization, "us and them" | We talk about "us" and "our business" collectively |

## Problems You May Recognize

### From

1. There is still confusion about people's roles and responsibilities.

2. People are placed into roles within an agile delivery team without the experience, training, or support to set them up for success.

3. Some people are unclear as to what is expected of them in order to progress in their career, or what options are available to them in Schroders.

4. Delivery teams are reliant on a large number of people ("supporting roles") to deliver value to their clients and customers. A lack of consistency in the cadence and processes used by the supporting roles can result in avoidable delays, for example, the need to book a test environment that is in a suitable state for testing.

5. The Schroders landscape is hard to navigate, especially for new people, because they do not know who to approach to get things done, which can make progress laborious.

6. Poor tools/IT setup routinely hampers effective collaboration.

7. A culture of "us and them" means that those in "the business" and those in "technology" seldom talk or collaborate to explore common goals. Technology is seen as a solutions provider rather than a core part of the Schroders business.

### Where We'd Like to Get To

### To

1. People's roles and responsibilities are clearly documented in a single, central location that is accessible to everyone.

2. New and existing people in agile delivery teams have the experience, training, and support they need to be successful in their role.

3. Competency frameworks and career pathways ensure those in the agile delivery teams know what is expected of them in order to progress to the next level, and what career options are available to them in Schroders.

4. Delivery teams work effectively with those outside their teams - gaining new skills and becoming "t-shaped" as they do so. They are enabled by self-service tooling and automation, helping them to become more empowered and achieve their missions more easily over time.

5. A formalized mentoring/'buddy' system helps new people to find their way around and get up to speed. Knowledge sharing between and across colleagues in different teams is given importance and participation in Communities of Practice are encouraged.

6. We strive to ensure our tools/IT setup is a true enabler and every problem is logged and investigated to ensure things get demonstrably better over time.

7. People refer to "our business", rather than "the business" and "technology", and business people and technology people work together daily to efficiently achieve common business outcomes.

## Enabling People & Collaboration

### People

#### Roles, Responsibilities and Careers

To succeed, we require efficient collaboration, adaptation, and flexibility. This will not happen until we get the right people in place and provide clarity on how each role fits together. The roles, responsibilities, and expectations of each person in a team must be clearly defined so that everyone knows what they are expected to do, and how they are expected to collaborate and contribute to the success of our business.

#### T-shaping

In a recent [McKinsey Global Survey](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/beyond-hiring-how-companies-are-reskilling-to-address-talent-gaps), 87% of leaders acknowledged skill gaps in their workforces â€” yet less than half of respondents had a clear plan for confronting this challenge.

At Schroders, we wish to promote the idea of T-shaped colleagues. While generalists know a little about a lot of subjects and I-shaped employees are experts in a single area, a T-shaped person is a subject-matter expert in at least one area and knowledgeable or skilled in several others.

![T-Shaped Skills](People%20and%20Collaboration_media/media/image4.png)

The vertical bar on the letter T represents the depth of your skills and expertise in a field, whereas the horizontal bar is your breadth or ability to collaborate across disciplines with experts in other areas and apply knowledge to areas beyond your primary field.

This flexibility allows team members to pick up tasks which may have previously required additional assistance, giving everyone more autonomy to resolve blocking issues and dependencies.

At the individual level, you can become more T-shaped by cross-training in areas adjacent to your own area of deep expertise. By gaining familiarity and fluency in adjacent topics, you will increase breadth and, eventually, your depth in those areas. Investing in T-shaped skills will strengthen collaboration and communication for team members and between teams.

### Collaboration

Two of the four values in the Agile Manifesto highlight the emphasis Agile ways of working place on strong collaboration.

- **"Individuals and interactions over processes and tools"** reminds us of the importance of regular, effective communication. For example, rather than testers and developers using a defect tracking tool to record, manage and handle bug fixes and handovers, they are encouraged to sit and work together to recreate and resolve issues.

- **"Customer collaboration over contract negotiation"** reminds us that it's more important for a team to be flexible and seek collaborative solutions to issues that might arise during product development, rather than rigidly sticking to upfront requirements and proposed solutions.

### Working Together

Collaboration simply means to work jointly rather than independently to accomplish a task.

Agile ways of working emphasize bringing together teams and business partners and encourage effective communication. This is important because our business partners provide an understanding of the problem and outcome, and teams need this to develop the right solution. This is where it is important we collaborate early and often.

Collaborating early means that we work together during upfront strategic conversations (discovery) as well as downstream tactical ones (implementation), opening up the possibility of discovering new and unseen solutions. Collaborating often means that we continue these conversations throughout implementation, ensuring strategy and tactics remain aligned, and giving us more opportunities to adjust course as needed.

Collaboration is also especially important among team members. Rather than working in silos, agile ways of working promote frequent and rich communication between all team members which enables the transfer of skills and knowledge.

True collaboration requires openness, vulnerability, and the willingness to share ownership of ideas. It requires asking a question before you know the answer and being prepared to receive an answer you did not expect.

### People & Collaboration and Leadership

If we are to achieve greater agility we need to enable a more fundamental shift in behaviors. As a leader, you need to look beyond the obvious and consider the cultural and behavioral elements that restrict collaboration.

One way to do this is to consider if we currently work in a "Report and Critique" culture or a "Collaborative" one. A "Report and Critique" culture is one in which teams do their work and then hold meetings to tell other teams about that work. Other teams are only able to offer inputs on something that has already been completed, resulting in contributions that feel more like critique than collaboration.

The table below demonstrates how a "Report and Critique" culture is very different from a truly collaborative, Agile culture.

| **Report and Critique Culture** | **Collaborative Agile Culture** |

|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Meetings are a chance to present work that has already been completed | Meetings are a chance to share ideas and make decisions about works in progress |

| Interaction with people from other teams or functions is inefficient and to be avoided unless there is an immediate tactical dependency to be resolved | Interaction with people from other teams or functions is seen as a way to get out ahead of potential future dependencies and conflicts |

| Each team has distinct---and at times conflicting---goals | Each team's goals are aligned under overall company and customer goals |

| Team divisions and chains of command are absolute and unchanging | Team divisions and chains of command can be reorganized temporarily around customer needs |

A question to ask ourselves, "What can I do to ease the shift to the right-hand side?"
