# Understanding How Our Work Contributes to Our Overall Purpose (CDF Pattern)



Everyone should understand how the work they do contributes to our overall purpose and the success of Schroders.

***"We invest in the best interests of our clients to accelerate positive change in the world." -- Peter Harrison***

Regardless of where you work in Schroders, it should be possible to understand the impact of your work. This understanding provides a sense of purpose, and we know from the work of [**Daniel Pink**](https://www.danpink.com/books/) that it's intrinsic motivational factors such as having a strong sense of purpose that drives people at work and makes them want to excel.

Purpose is the desire to do work in the service of something greater than you. An example of this can be seen in the open-source software community where people develop products in their own time and are happy to work for free.

***"If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up people to collect wood and don’t assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea." - Antoine de Saint-Exupéry***

## How

It's important to regularly communicate where we are trying to get to so that our objectives are uppermost in people's minds. Establishing a shared understanding of what the future will look like is a key responsibility of leaders.

There are specific tools and techniques that can help with this. Within GT, for example, well-written [**Product Backlog Items (PBIs), Features, and Epics**](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/388a414f-4b39-4a75-85ba-621264a4b949.aspx) can show how work contributes to our Objectives and Key Results (OKRs). Product goals and sprint goals can also articulate the progression towards our strategy and purpose.

A Lean Value Tree (LVT) is another tool that can prove helpful. The diagram below is a Schroders example of a Lean Value Tree, which shows that there is a visual link between the [**Schroders purpose**](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/hyuUry4Wj7I65ADAOxSxiQ/a3dfd1a3-aa12-4b88-8de4-b1ab90ead7b5.aspx), [the 3 pillars](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/wd7BlAYz4d0OEeldZNFQyA/06d388ac-7a70-492d-9da1-56bd357de16c.aspx) that make up our long-term strategy, and the activities at each of the levels below that all contribute to our overall purpose. This makes the influence of each one clear to everyone.

In some instances, it might make sense to combine multiple tools and techniques to ensure everyone understands how their work contributes to our overall purpose.

## Why is This Important?

In addition to helping to provide intrinsic motivation, making this link clear will help with prioritization. In particular, it will help to deprioritize work that doesn't clearly contribute to our strategy and purpose.

This will also help us to [**limit work in progress**](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/8f28ec5a-7b86-4fbc-bdf4-9d61c142d1bf.aspx) and improve the flow of value to customers.
