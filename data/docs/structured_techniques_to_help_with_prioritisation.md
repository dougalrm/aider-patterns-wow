# Structured Techniques to Help with Prioritisation (CDF Pattern)



Prioritisation can be difficult, especially when there are many competing priorities. Determining the relative priority of multiple [**Product Backlog Items**](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/388a414f-4b39-4a75-85ba-621264a4b949.aspx) requires consideration of multiple needs and contexts—often more than any one person can hold in their head. This is where key roles, including Delivery Lead (DL), Product Lead (PL), and Engineering Lead (EL), come together to form a holistic view and decide what is best based on business benefit.

There are multiple factors on which prioritisation decisions can be made and these can be very specific to the domain or context. Avoid gut reactions by making use of data and trends to back up beliefs. Where data is not available, think about how to gather it in the future. Think long-term about how this piece of work ties priorities to the wider Schroders strategy, as well as dealing with short-term priorities. Make time to regularly prioritise; change happens and we need to adapt.

## Structured Techniques to Help with Prioritisation

The prioritisation process is often made easier by using a recognized, structured technique. Some examples that might help include:

- **Value vs Complexity**

- **Cost of Delay**

- **Kano Analysis Model**

- **MoSCoW**

- **Opportunity Score**

- **Story Mapping**

- **Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF)**

- **RICE Score**

Below we cover these techniques in more detail.

### Value versus Complexity Quadrant

In the Value versus Complexity model, you evaluate every opportunity based on its business value and its relative complexity to implement. For each initiative under consideration, the team will make two separate assessments:

1. How much value it anticipates the initiative to deliver.

2. How much effort implementing it will require.

The objective of this prioritisation exercise is to uncover those initiatives that promise to deliver the most value for the least effort. The image below shows the Value vs Effort quadrant diagram which helps to identify the work we should target.

![Value vs Effort quadrant diagram](Structured%20techniques%20to%20help%20with%20prioritisation_media/media/image2.png)

Using this technique identifies the upper left quadrant of high value, low effort as a good place to start, and the bottom right quadrant of high effort, low value as work to avoid.

You can read more about how to use this technique in [**this article**](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/value-vs-complexity/).

### Cost of Delay

The cost of delay is the economic impact of delay in a project and is a useful way of communicating the impact of time on the outcomes we hope to achieve.

Cost of Delay combines an understanding of value with how that value depreciates over time. For example:

- The amount of money you will lose if you delay a product launch.

- The amount of money you will lose if you delay the release of a feature that would give you a competitive advantage.

- The amount of money you will lose if you fail to deliver a strategic initiative.

- The amount of money you will lose if a critical defect is not resolved.

Cost of Delay is usually communicated as the "CD3 value," which is the Cost of Delay Divided by Duration. It’s calculated for each initiative, feature, or task by:

1. Calculating the expected work's weekly profit/value.

2. Calculating approximately how much time it would take to implement it.

3. Dividing the value by the estimated duration of the work.

The table below shows an example:

| Length (No. of Sprints) | Expected Value | CD3 Value |

|-------------------------|----------------|-----------------------|

| Feature 1 | 2 | £5,000 | £5,000/2 = **£2,500** |

| Feature 2 | 4 | £30,000 | £30,000/4 = **£7,500** |

| Feature 3 | 8 | £50,000 | £50,000/8 = **£6,250** |

| **Total** | 14 | £85,000 | N/A |

Doing this calculation will give you an item's CD3 value, and **the higher the value, the more important a piece of work becomes from an economical point of view**, since its return on investment will be faster.

You can read more about calculating the Cost of Delay and how you can use it in [**this article**](https://www.leadingagile.com/2015/06/an-introduction-to-cost-of-delay/) and [**this article**](https://kanbanize.com/lean-management/value-waste/cost-of-delay).

### Kano Analysis Model

The Kano Analysis Model is a Lean Six Sigma tool that helps prioritize product features based on how much the feature will delight the customer. Using the Kano Model, product teams pull together a list of potential new features vying for development resources and space on the roadmap. The team will then weigh these features according to two competing criteria:

1. Their potential to satisfy customers.

2. The investment needed to implement them.

The model suggests grouping your features into five categories, three to include and two to avoid.

#### One to Include:

- Basic / Threshold features - which customers expect and your product 'needs' to be competitive.

- Excitement features - these yield a disproportionate increase in customer delight, such as unique innovations.

- Performance features - these give you a proportionate increase in customer satisfaction, such as decreased processing time.

#### Ones to Avoid:

- Indifferent features - which customers won't care about.

- Dissatisfaction features - which will upset customers.

![The Kano Analysis Model](Structured%20techniques%20to%20help%20with%20prioritisation_media/media/image3.png)

You can see that, if a product's features don’t meet a customer's Threshold Attributes, their satisfaction levels will be very low. However, even if you fully deliver on these, you won't impress customers that much.

The Kano Model can be a helpful framework for product teams with limited time and resources who want to make sure they prioritize the appropriate mix of features to work on next.

You can read more about the Kano model in [**this article**](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/kano-model/).

### MoSCoW

MoSCoW is a useful tool to sort through a list of requirements and determine which should be developed. The MoSCoW acronym represents four categories:

- **Must have (Mo)** - Critical requirements

- **Should have (Sc)** - Important but not critical

- **Could have (Co)** - Desirable but not essential

- **Won't have, at least for now (W)** - Not a priority currently

This method can be used for just about anything, but is most often used to prioritize requirements, with the premise that not everything is essential and some requirements can go into a different category.

![The MoSCoW prioritisation method](Structured%20techniques%20to%20help%20with%20prioritisation_media/media/image4.png)

You can read more about the MoSCoW prioritisation method and how you can use it in [**this article**](https://www.appvizer.co.uk/magazine/operations/project-management/moscow-prioritisation) or [**this article**](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/moscow-prioritization/).

### Opportunity Score

Opportunity Score is part of the Opportunity-Driven Innovation framework created by Anthony W. Ulwick. Opportunity scoring analyses the gap between the importance that customers assign to the expected outcome of a job-to-be-done and how satisfied they are with their current solutions.

To conduct opportunity scoring, you ask customers to rate the importance of several features in your product and then to rate how satisfied they are with each. Those features that score high in importance and low in satisfaction represent your opportunities.

For more about this technique, have a look at [**this article**](https://medium.com/uxr-microsoft/what-is-the-opportunity-score-and-how-to-obtain-it-bb81fcbf79b7).

### Story Mapping

Story mapping facilitates product discovery and prioritisation of development work. It is the visualisation of the journey the customer takes with a product from beginning to end and is achieved by putting user activities and tasks along two independent dimensions that serve to keep them in context.

The 'map' arranges user activities along the horizontal axis roughly in the order in which the user would perform the task. Down the vertical axis, user stories are ordered by priority and/or increasing sophistication of the implementation.

![Story Mapping](Structured%20techniques%20to%20help%20with%20prioritisation_media/media/image5.png)

The first horizontal row represents a skeleton or backbone—a basic but usable version of the product. Successive rows flesh out the product with additional functionality to be developed in further iterations or releases.

Jeff Patton is credited with developing this idea and his book 'User Story Mapping: Discover the Whole Story, Build the Right Product' is well worth a read. [**His website**](https://www.jpattonassociates.com/story-mapping/) also includes useful articles and presentations on this technique.

### Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF)

Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF) is a prioritisation model used to sequence jobs (e.g., Features, Capabilities, and Epics) to produce maximum economic benefit.

In SAFe, WSJF is estimated as the SAFe Cost of Delay (CoD) divided by job size. I.e., you assign a weight, or value, to each job, and then divide that by the length of the job to determine a relative ranking. **WSJF = (user/business value + time criticality + (risk reduction (RR) + opportunity enablement (OE) value)) / job size.**

- **User/business value** indicates the benefit received.

- **Time criticality** indicates the importance of doing the project now.

- **Risk reduction** and **opportunity enablement** indicate the work either positions the company to make follow-on initiatives or mitigates risk.

- **Job size** indicates the duration or size.

The scale for each parameter uses the Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34) and is derived relative to the other pieces of work (jobs). Each parameter is calculated for every job before working on the next parameter. Job size can use a different scale as long as it is applied consistently.

![Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF)](Structured%20techniques%20to%20help%20with%20prioritisation_media/media/image6.png)

The [**Scaled Agile Framework website has an article**](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/wsjf/) covering how to calculate WSJF in detail.

This [**TechBeacon article**](https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/prioritize-your-backlog-use-weighted-shortest-job-first-wsjf-improved-roi) looks at WSJF and covers some of the advantages and disadvantages of this method.

*Note: The SAFe described Cost of Delay is different (a more specific type) from the Cost of Delay technique mentioned earlier.*

### RICE Score

RICE is an acronym for the four factors we use to evaluate each idea: Reach, Impact, Confidence, and Effort.

This simple method calculates a score by multiplying **Reach** x **Impact** x **Confidence** and dividing this by **Effort**. These are defined as follows:

- **Reach:** How many people will this impact? (Estimate within a defined time period.)

- **Impact:** How much will this impact each person?

- **Confidence:** How confident are you in your estimates?

- **Effort:** How long will this take? (Use whole iterations—don’t get into the weeds of estimation.)

Similar to other methods, the higher the score, the higher the priority. For more on this method, have a look at [**this Intercom article**](https://www.intercom.com/blog/rice-simple-prioritization-for-product-managers/).
