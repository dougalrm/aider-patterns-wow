# Inspect & Adapt to Continuously Improve - Retrospectives (CDF Pattern)



## Why Should We Inspect and Adapt?

Inspecting and adapting is an enabler of continuous improvement and learning, allowing us to learn from our failures and successes and feed that learning back into our ways of working.

Every team, at every level of Schroders should hold regular retrospectives (retros) to examine and improve both what they do and how they do it - both locally and organization-wide. This works for development teams, product teams, HR teams, leadership teams, and more. Any form of team can benefit from a retro.

## What is a Retrospective?

A retrospective is a meeting or workshop that ensures the entire team takes time to pause and reflect on what transpired, and discuss what worked and what didn't during a particular period or piece of work.

In a retrospective, your team reflects on the past to improve the future. Regardless of your team type, technical or non-technical teams, you can retro on just about any subject. The principles of the agile manifesto make it clear: In order to best live the agile values, teams should meet regularly to check in and make adjustments, or in other words, inspect and adapt.

The insights revealed during retrospectives can be turned into improvement actions that are prioritized alongside the team's other work. Blockers, sources of friction, frustration, or waste that cannot be addressed at the team level, should be raised to leaders or communities that are dedicated to solving systemic issues.

Retrospectives are conducted within a safe space. What happens in the retro, stays in the retro -- unless the team agrees that specific insights should be shared outside of the team. The team also decides on who should attend.

## How Do We Do Retrospectives?

The key components of a retrospective should be structured around:

1. **Setting the Stage**

2. **Gathering Data**

3. **Generating Insights**

4. **Deciding What to Do**

5. **Closing the Retrospective**

It's worth stating these phases aren't strictly linear. Retros usually aren't single-topic, and as such, it might be good to create actions before moving on to another topic.

### Example: Simple Retro Format (1 Hour)

#### Set the Stage (5 mins)

Welcome everyone and establish the rules:

- Embrace a spirit of unconditional positive regard and sharing.

- Don't make it personal, don't take it personally.

- Listen to each other, with an open mind, all experiences are valid.

- Set some boundaries for the retrospective. Are you considering the last few weeks, the last quarter, or the last sprint/campaign?

- Encourage the team to embrace a continuous improvement mindset.

#### What Went Well? (15 mins)

- Start the session on a positive note with each team member using sticky notes to write down what they feel went well (one idea per sticky).

- Stick them up (grouping into themes as you go) and discuss each one briefly to gain a common understanding.

#### What Needs Improvement? (15 mins)

- Follow the same format, but this time use different colored sticky notes to write down what needs improvement.

- This is an opportunity to examine things that haven't been going so well. But it's not about individuals or blame.

#### Next Steps (15 mins)

- Now review the positive and negative themes and identify some concrete actions that the team can take to improve.

- Discuss each action and then vote on which ones are the most important.

#### Wrap Up (10 mins)

- The whole team agrees on which actions they commit to doing, and then assigns an owner and a due date.

- At the next retrospective, the team will review these actions to see what progress has been made.

- Finally, thank everyone for their involvement and their honesty.

## Important Consideration

Implementing action items takes time. If you do retrospectives but nobody ever has time to follow up on the action items or implement change, people will quickly grow disillusioned and stop doing retros because there's little point if nothing ever changes as a result of the retros. Adding the action items to the team board is a way of making these visible and getting them done.

## Hints and Tips

- Find a space where you can be open with each other, free from distraction -- away from laptops, etc.

- Spend time considering people, relationships, process, and tools.

- Examine what went well and potential areas for improvement, and see what you can learn from them.

- Create an action plan for implementing the improvements you want to make as a team.

- Take the time to truly identify the root cause of problems and don't routinely deprioritize or rush these events.

- Create a level playing field, if one person is online, it may be worth all members being online.

It may be helpful to use the 'Prime Directive' as an intro to the session, or even to create your own as a team.

The purpose of the Prime Directive is to assure that a retrospective has the right culture to make it a positive and result-oriented event. It makes a retrospective become an effective team gathering to learn and find solutions to improve the way of working.

_"Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand."_

--Norm Kerth, Project Retrospectives: A Handbook for Team Review

When developing actions, it may be useful to consider the 'Spheres of Influence' model. If we don't focus on things that you can affect, the retrospective can quite quickly end up with ranting and energy going down.

## Retrospective Ideas

For retrospective ideas, [the website Retromat](https://retromat.org/en/) gives a selection of examples of activities to cover each section that can be mixed and matched. Spotify has also [produced a retrospective kit](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2017/12/spotify-retro-kit/) which covers several examples.

In some cases, retrospectives can be much shorter and focused, e.g., at the end of a workshop, follow the same structure but go round the room to gather insight.

## Why Hold Retrospectives?

The point of a retrospective is to enable teams to inspect, adapt, and improve. It is time that's reserved to examine ways to improve both what we are doing (the products we produce), and how we are doing it (the way we work together).

It also:

- Provides a safe space for the team to reflect on and discuss how they are working together -- what works, and what doesn't.

- Creates shared understanding in the team. Everybody sees the world a little bit differently. In retrospectives, we can find out how our teammates perceive and interpret events.

- Helps them identify where improvements can be made across different factors of the team. This may involve changing the team's working agreement/charter or trying new things.

- Helps them to understand each other better and grow stronger as a team.

- Over time, this incremental process enables teams to make significant improvements.

Doing retros frequently will often allow you to catch and address problems while they're small and still manageable.

## Further Insights:

Other practices aside from regular team retrospectives that can be used by teams include major milestone or release retrospectives, Post Incident Reviews (PIR), blameless post-mortem, or any other activity that looks to:

1. Meet

2. Talk about stuff

3. Agree on some actions that will improve the situation

Or consider the proactive approach of a [pre-mortem](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/use-a-pre-mortem-to-identify-project-risks-before-they-occur) or [futurespectives](https://lizkeogh.com/2018/09/12/how-to-run-a-futurespective/). This allows the team to imagine that a milestone or release has failed and work backward to determine what potentially could lead to failure.

### What is a Retrospective NOT:

- A blame game.

- Just another meeting in which talk is cheap but no change follows.

- An opportunity to shift ownership and accountability.
