# Delivery Focused Ways of Working

The Ways of Working patterns provide information about good practice or guide you in solving specific problems, and they're underpinned by [**our five ways of working principles.**](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/de10612a-0346-4267-83ec-cafb3e8a88d7.aspx)



The pages below contain the principles, practices, methods, and processes that are recommended or required to be adopted by our teams.

Each pattern explains the expected benefits and provides practical guidance and approaches to solving common problems.

## What's Covered on This Page

Below we've grouped the patterns into the following categories:

- **Mandatory** – ones that all teams within GT are required to adopt

- **Highly Recommended** – ones that should be a priority to adopt

- **Recommended** – ones to adopt if they tackle a problem you face

### Ways of Working (Delivery)

Below you will find patterns with a delivery focus. However, this doesn't mean they are exclusive to that discipline.

### Mandatory

| **Pattern Name** | **Summary** |

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| [Tracking key metrics to improve delivery efficiency (Cycle Time and Defect Ratio)](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/4845e02e-dfaa-4cdf-88f8-a1fb4578b58a.aspx) | There are two key metrics that are fundamental to measuring the efficiency of software delivery at Schroders. All software delivery teams in Global Technology (GT) must be tracking them. |

| [Common workflow states to improve reporting](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/a0c57e41-50e0-481d-81f9-fc8686dba2f3.aspx) | The workflow used by all the teams in GT within any given workflow tool must contain certain common states to bring the consistency required for metrics, reporting, and auditing. |

| [Iterative & incremental working](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/dc7c0b13-1a7a-4646-ab14-e41cf6792d17.aspx) | Agile development is based on iterative and incremental development of a product or initiative. Rather than pre-planning everything, small, incremental plans are created and executed upon with feedback in between. |

| [Adopting the appropriate agile method: Scrum vs Kanban](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/YASyWyZ006UdMmjiDSgqSQ/1afe113f-f808-4f9a-b97e-9b592e82d061.aspx) | Agile methods place the emphasis on people over process. They are about bringing people together to find the most appropriate and effective way of working, and then using this to iteratively work towards the outcomes they want to achieve. |

### Highly Recommended

| **Pattern Name** | **Summary** |

|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| [Well written requirements](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/fa4cd4ae-96e0-4184-9551-2cd71b532367.aspx) | Attempts to define a full and detailed set of requirements too early often prove to be counterproductive. Requirements are negotiated through conversations that happen continuously. |

| [Understanding how our work contributes to our overall purpose](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/f5a15f2e-81de-4ec6-b29f-920bccd23e46.aspx) | Everyone at Schroders should be able to trace a clear path from the work they're doing right through to company strategy. |

| [Inspect & adapt to continuously improve (Retrospectives)](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/11323923-036e-4eb7-9d15-12856e7b2a0b.aspx) | Inspecting and adapting is an enabler of continuous improvement, allowing us to learn from our failures and successes and feed that learning back into our ways of working. Retrospectives help us examine and improve both what we do and how we do it. |

| [Limit Work In Progress (WIP) at every level. Stop Starting, Start Finishing](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/8f28ec5a-7b86-4fbc-bdf4-9d61c142d1bf.aspx) | Having many unfinished things in progress wastes effort by frequently switching attention and subsequent rework. The more we have in progress the longer it takes to deliver anything. |

| [Beyond PI Planning: Iterating and adapting to be more effective](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/51f5ccee-92b7-439c-9e2f-5bc6ccf2f564.aspx) | To continuously improve the way we deliver value to our business, we are changing the way we work. As we move beyond the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe), we are replacing PI Planning with 'Feature Planning'. |

| [Delivery Plans: Communicating and coordinating delivery](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/CIWsscu83QKHLo3NKRvg/530254f9-8222-4bb6-a35c-10b41f5dd835.aspx) | Delivery plans facilitate discussions on capacity and sequencing, providing clarity and confidence. They also help to identify and manage dependencies, risks, and issues, and help to communicate progress to stakeholders. |

| [Making work visible - visualisation tools and techniques](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/TuoEoMHoPD915wmmXqIiQ/c509e9ac-84ad-4539-af8e-2c43220d98ab.aspx) | Visualisation is a powerful tool for explaining complex concepts and promoting communication and collaboration. It allows teams to share a common understanding of data and radiate critical information about their work. |

### Recommended

| **Pattern Name** | **Summary** |

|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| [Recognising systemic impediments](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/ID6VBaZIXQPTWxMkPM5uw/14c1a8d6-9ad4-49ab-a0ec-e9504707cf21.aspx) | Systemic impediments have far-reaching effects that are beyond the remit or ability of a single team or domain to resolve. |

| [Categorising work using an understanding of complexity (Cynefin)](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/b36805f8-cf48-47ce-a831-c885989289d1.aspx) | Categorising knowledge work into types of complexity helps us understand the nature of the problems we are solving and ensures we apply the right approach. |

| [Clear Definition of Ready](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/7b41446b-109e-4460-99ac-37ce8c62dd91.aspx) | Pulling unfinished or unrefined work into an iteration causes problems. A "Definition of Ready" helps ensure the work a team does is of the appropriate quality. |

| [Shorter planning horizons to increase agility](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/1nbaFUYSA3XRQlX51UQ9g/9792c2bf-d3bc-418f-a0c1-45bf02778573.aspx?xsdata=MDV8MDF8fGJlZTNmOWIzODM1YzRjMzJlMTFkMDhkYjQxYTc2YWE2fDJmNTdiNmM0MTdlNDQ5NjVhYzFhODVjY2NjYmU2YzRhfDB8MHw2MzgxNzU5NTk1MDc3MjI1MjV8VW5rbm93bnxWR1ZoYlhOVFpXTjFjbWwwZVZObGNuWnBZMlY4ZXlKV0lqb2lNQzR3TGpBd01EQWlMQ0pRSWpvaVYybHVNeklpTENKQlRpSTZJazkwYUdWeUlpd2lWMVFpT2pFeGZRPT18MXxNVFk0TVRrNU9URTFNREExTWpzeE5qZ3hPVGs1TVRVd01EVXlPekU1T2pNMlltVmlNVGhoTFdJMk4yVXROR0prTnkwNE1tUmxMVGhsTjJRd01XTTVNRGt4TUY4MVkyVXlOR1E1T1MwMVkySXhMVFE1WkRFdE9UQTFNaTFqTm1ReE5tUmpaakZoTmpCQWRXNXhMbWRpYkM1emNHRmpaWE09fGVmYWEzMjI4ZTFiMDQzOWE3ZWNmMDhkYjQxYTc2YWE0fGQyMWFiZjZmMDViMzRiNTNhYTExZTEwNTNlMjQ0NzU1&sdata=aHdQaVVNeFdOMHgzeGFWY1hmcDlIY2dicDNreXc5MFJHRHZnMnR5eG9UTT0%3D&ovuser=2f57b6c4-17e4-4965-ac1a-85ccccbe6c4a%2cBen.Mountifield%40Schroders.com&OR=Teams-HL&CT=1681999605045&clickparams=eyJBcHBOYW1lIjoiVGVhbXMtRGVza3RvcCIsIkFwcFZlcnNpb24iOiIyNy8yMzAzMDUwMTExMCIsIkhhc0ZlZGVyYXRlZFVzZXIiOmZhbHNlfQ%3D%3D) | The core of agility is an [iterative and incremental approach](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/dc7c0b13-1a7a-4646-ab14-e41cf6792d17.aspx) to software development, emphasizing flexibility, rapid feedback, and frequent delivery of working software. Shorter planning horizons help achieve this by planning and executing work in smaller time frames, typically ranging from one to six weeks. |

| [Allowing capacity for improvement](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/e15b6363-17c6-4167-a3fa-93e0569f9d88.aspx) | To be most effective, we must balance dedicating time to achieving our business outcomes and dedicating time to improve our ability to do so. |

| [Using metrics to identify impediments and improve delivery efficiency - Flow Metrics](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/6ee92e3d-3dfd-498f-8203-1d77f132e82c.aspx) | Flow metrics provide insights into how efficiently work flows through our end-to-end workflow process, enabling significant efficiency improvements. |

| [Improving Productivity - Resource Efficiency vs Flow Efficiency](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/ZnItogF7IpiI2HA9asSMiA/098e6a34-642e-4d91-ae40-365f84191819.aspx) | Productivity and efficiency are crucial to success at Schroders, but also have the potential to be problematic. |

| [Recognising & tackling team-level impediments](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/J2yM0atCqqk8E6VdblTQ/b7321862-7a74-40ed-85db-f048e751b21b.aspx) | Teams may face impediments, which are anything that slows down or hinders team productivity, affecting the successful delivery of a product. |

## A Learning Journey for Those in a Delivery Role

There is a learning journey in Spark called [**Agile Fundamentals**](https://schroders.edcast.com/journey/agile-fundamentals) designed to give a foundational understanding of the benefits of agile ways of working, the agile values and principles, and the most popular Agile methodologies used within Global Technology (GT).

It provides a structured way to learn, proving useful to those moving into a role in the Delivery Family, such as Associate PMO Analyst or Associate Delivery Lead, or those wanting to cement their understanding.

The eight sections use a mix of written articles and videos to introduce Agile methodologies, contrast them with traditional project management, and explore frameworks like Scrum and Kanban.

The four hours of content also cover estimation, planning, collaboration, and metrics, as well as what it takes to nurture self-organizing teams, and what it means to develop an Agile mindset.

_NB: Currently, Spark (our global learning platform) is only available to permanent Schroders employees._
