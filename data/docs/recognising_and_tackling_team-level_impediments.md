# Recognising & Tackling Team-Level Impediments (CDF Pattern)



One of our five ways of working principles is [**Continuous Improvement**](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/d88bc27f-dd37-4d04-878e-c46efea9d098.aspx). This is about regularly taking the time to identify sources of friction, frustration, and waste so that we can take steps to tackle them and improve what we do.

From time to time, teams will suffer from impediments—anything that slows down or hinders the productivity of a team, hence affecting the successful delivery of a product. An impediment acts like a parachute, slowing down overall progress. This can be considered different from a 'blocker,' which is a much more singular issue affecting perhaps only a single task. Impediments are much wider in their area of effect and are usually tougher to solve, leading us to shy away from addressing them.

Everyone on the team shares responsibility for identifying impediments. It’s vital for teams to continually identify new sources of friction, frustration, and waste, and embed the right practices into their daily ways of working so that they can be overcome.

## Examples of Impediments

Sometimes impediments can be staring us in the face, but we are so close to the detail we don't see them as such. Below is a brief list of examples, some you may recognize within your teams today:

- An issue with the development environment preventing the teams from pushing code through the build pipeline.

- Approvals required from outside the team.

- Team unable to self-organize.

- Lack of technical knowledge and/or key-person dependencies.

- Delayed product decisions affecting development progress.

- Ineffective team collaboration and interpersonal conflict.

## Tips for Tackling Impediments

### Recognising Impediments

Agile teams have an advantage when it comes to recognizing impediments, as the regular cadence of ceremonies, frequent collaboration, and regular reflection help to focus on and identify problems. Daily stand-ups and Scrum of Scrum events are great forums to prompt for impediments. Retrospectives also allow teams to examine what they do, and various techniques can be used to unearth impediments. By examining your metrics and understanding the trends, you can look for patterns. Other sources of impediments may come from observations, feedback, reviewing risks, or looking at the backlog.

### Make Impediments Visible

Raise impediments early on rather than ignoring the impacts and expecting someone else to address them. It may be helpful to keep track of your impediments on your work tracking software, such as your ADO board, so they can be prioritized alongside your other work in upcoming iterations. This has the added benefit of ensuring sufficient capacity to address them properly. Dig into the root of the impediment. Stop spending time and effort solving the wrong problem.

With impediments, we should resist the desire to implement the first solution we think of. We should focus on understanding the real problem. Do this by asking questions to understand the situation and developing a hypothesis that can be used to test whether what you did was effective. Below, we have suggested some techniques to help with understanding the root cause beyond the symptoms you might be experiencing.

### Collaborate with Others

Quite often, impediments will be related to a lack of collaboration with others. Engaging with your colleagues to crowdsource insights and brainstorm the issue can elicit a variety of ideas and solutions allowing us to more rapidly address our impediments. Start small. Are there any simple, low-hanging fruit impediments that will improve the environment, efficiency, and morale of the team? Lots of little incremental improvements add up over time.

### Local Optimisation Steps

Teams wishing to tackle a problem that's within their control may, as an example, follow these steps:

1. Identify the type of problem, e.g., team conflict.

2. Use tools/techniques to explore the root causes, e.g., 5 Dysfunctions of a Team.

3. Define/agree on the ideal target state, i.e., what good could look like. This could be in the form of a hypothesis.

4. Consider other factors such as impact vs. effort, do you need external support or specialist expertise? Is this the right solution for the situation?

5. Implement a small change to move towards the target state.

6. Review and assess the impact of the change. Have you proven your hypothesis?

7. Share what's been learned.

8. Repeat regularly.

## Techniques

Teams have many tools and techniques available to help them do this. These include:

- [**Sprint Retrospectives**](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/11323923-036e-4eb7-9d15-12856e7b2a0b.aspx) or major milestone or release retrospectives.

- [**Blameless Post-Mortem**](https://sre.google/sre-book/postmortem-culture/) are used to learn from incidents or problems in a way that promotes no finger-pointing or blaming of particular persons or teams, and aims to look backward to look forward and prevent issues from occurring again.

[**Guide to Running Blameless Post-Mortems**](https://www.smartsheet.com/content/blameless-postmortem-guide).

- [**Post Incident Review's (PIR)**](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newPPM_74.htm).

- [**Value Stream Mapping (VSM)**](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/principles/value-stream-mapping), a technique to analyze, design, and manage the flow of materials and information required to bring a product to a customer. By mapping out each step in our development process, we can look for inefficiencies and begin to tackle these.

- [**5 Dysfunctions of a Team**](https://confluence.schroders.com/display/ESD/The+Five+Dysfunctions+of+a+Team), which sets out a model for team performance, each level builds on the previous and highlights how to overcome some of the common dysfunctions found in any team.

- [**7 Types of Waste**](https://confluence.schroders.com/display/DIT/Waste). Lean thinking aims to remove waste from work processes and Lean defines 7 types of waste which can cause inefficiencies.

- Root cause analysis aims to get to a problem's essence and then fix it. An example such as the [**Fives Whys Technique**](https://kanbanize.com/lean-management/improvement/5-whys-analysis-tool) continues to explore the why behind a situation until you get to the true root cause. This can also be used in a [**Group/Workshop Setting**](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/3-nine-whys/).

Regardless of the tool we use, it's vital that teams are given the time and space to do this on a regular basis.

*"At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly."*

\- The 12th Agile Principle.

## Continuous Improvement Mindset

### Getting Good at Small Improvements

Sir David Brailsford became well-known for his application of business improvement and sports science to the world of cycling. As he explains in the video clip below, he carefully observed and listened to every member of the team to understand how or what they could improve, and he left no stone unturned. By getting very good at delivering small improvements, he achieved incredible success, and in doing so, he created a culture of continuous learning and continuous improvement.

### Local vs Systemic Impediments

Recognizing & tackling team-level impediments is highly valuable, but optimization at the organization level that deals with systemic and enterprise-wide impediments is also important. Local optimization without addressing the problems experienced by multiple teams is considered an anti-pattern. Within GT, we are cataloguing and developing a process for tackling impediments that are a source of frustration for all in Schroders. This is detailed more within the [Recognising & Tackling Organisation-Wide Impediments Article](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/ID6VBaZIXQPTWxMkPM5uw/14c1a8d6-9ad4-49ab-a0ec-e9504707cf21.aspx).
