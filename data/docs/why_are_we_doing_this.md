# Why are we doing this? (Common Delivery Framework)

This page outlines why agility is so important to our organisational strategy.

*"We need to become an efficient, adaptable and nimble organisation" - Jamie Ovenden, (Chief Technology Officer).*

## Agility as a Fundamental Enabler

The key message from the **February 2023 Global Technology Town Hall** \[[**recording** (opens new browser tab)](https://schroders.wistia.com/medias/yp6dhng3rc)\] was that we need to become an efficient, adaptable and nimble organisation, and that's why it's imperative that we really embrace agility. How teams work is fundamental to our success, and we want to evolve our ways of working and bring greater consistency to our ways of working across all our teams.

Our [**ways of working objective** (opens new browser tab)](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/YASyWyZ006UdMmjiDSgqSQ/f9f71e83-e0dd-43ab-b617-b0e6b615e601.aspx) for this year is to continue to improve our agile capabilities \[[**presentation** (opens new browser tab)](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschrodersdocuments/IT%20Documents/Global%20Technology/GT%20Town%20Halls%202022/GT%20Town%20Hall_February%202023_UK_FINAL%20VERSION%20PRESENTED.pptx)\], and it's only by doing this that we can harness the benefits of cloud, data, and all the other great initiatives that create the foundations of the "Quality Technology" that will support our business.

### Greater Agility Will Help Us Achieve:

1. Improved efficiency and effectiveness.

2. Earlier delivery of value to clients and staff.

3. Higher quality products and services.

4. A strong partnership between technology and our business divisions.

*"We have the opportunity to leave the downturn stronger then we entered it, and we must be ready to capitalise whilst others pull themselves back to their feet." - Richard Keers (Chief Financial Officer).*

## How Does the Common Delivery Framework Fit into Our Strategy?

Global Technology's overarching strategy is to become a more modern and progressive technology organisation. We will do this by focusing on the following strategic pillars:

- Becoming more engineering-led in our approach.

- Harnessing our talent.

- Accelerating our push to cloud.

- Using data to improve our operational and analytical capabilities.

- Enhancing our Agile capability by evolving our ways of working.

All of these are interlinked and must evolve in sync with one another. However, the focus now is to maximise the benefits of the cloud, data, engineering, etc., by enhancing our agility, and that's where the Common Delivery Framework (CDF) comes in.

### The Common Delivery Framework (CDF)

- Aims to help us evolve and mature our ways of working.

- Will enable rather than constrain.

- Acknowledges that the work we do varies.

- Establishes minimum standards that need to be in place.

- Aims to provide a measured level of consistency.

## Moving Beyond SAFe

To transform the way we deliver value to our business, we are changing the way we work, and as part of this, we are moving beyond the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe). SAFe helped us implement some valuable practices such as big room planning and was a useful tool in 2017 when it was introduced as part of LEAP (Launching Enterprise Agile Programme).

However, LEAP did not include some key groups of people (business stakeholders), key roles (e.g., product), and important projects (e.g., Swift). It was also seen by some people as a "project" with an end date. All this resulted in inconsistent ways of working with some people having no support and not being set up for success in their roles.

Importantly, SAFe should always have been our starting point, and not our end goal. This is why we are now going beyond SAFe to help ensure we're successful for another 200 years.

## Looking Back on the March 2022 Town Hall

Early last year (2022), Jamie Ovenden, CTO, presented the Global Technology (GT) strategy consisting of four pillars that are fundamental to achieving the ambitions of the firm, improving life for our clients, improving our returns, and combating the challenges we face from others in the market, including passive funds.

He also introduced the CDF as the tool to help us improve our ways of working to more fully adopt agile principles so that we can deliver the best way we can in the most sustainable way we can.

Jamie also introduced the [**2022 GT OKRs** (opens new browser tab)](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/XeHDBpKDVFziBxivUrK0A/da6be5df-528b-46c4-aa9d-7b3e34d50f80.aspx), including the specific Ways of Working OKR: "The organisation is able to deliver fast, efficient and effective change". This [**Town Hall recording** (opens new browser tab)](https://schroders.wistia.com/medias/bf7izmsudi) provides valuable context for the journey we've been on.
