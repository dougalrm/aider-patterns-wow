title: Limit Work In Progress

description: This guide explores the importance of limiting Work In Progress (WIP) to enhance productivity and reduce cognitive overload. By minimizing multitasking and implementing WIP limits through tools like Kanban boards, teams can optimize workflow, reduce bottlenecks, and improve efficiency, leading to faster delivery and higher-quality outputs.

# Limit Work In Progress (WIP) at Every Level: Stop Starting, Start Finishing

[**Back to the Patterns overview page**](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/XeHDBpKDVFziBxivUrK0A/c8357f9c-361f-4a21-868b-339a7cfa1295.aspx)

The more work we have in progress, the slower and less productive we will be. Individuals and teams should limit work in progress (WIP) and stop multitasking so they can get more done.

## Stop Starting, Start Finishing

Work in Progress, or WIP, is simply the amount of work we are actively working on at any one time. It's work that is started but hasn't been delivered, and is therefore typically not providing value.

The more work we have in progress, the longer it takes to get something completed, and even a small increase in the amount of work or number of projects you are juggling can have a big impact on how long they take.

## More Work in Progress Results in Longer Lead Time

In a simplistic example, if it takes 5 steps to build a house and each step takes one day, then it will take 5 days to build one house, i.e., your lead time is 5 days. However, if you increase your work in progress and work on 4 houses at the same time, your lead time will almost quadruple to 18.5 days.

## The High Price of Multitasking and Context Switching

Compounding this is the fact that the more we attempt to do at any one time, the more we tend to switch between tasks, and this increases the requirement to manage both the delivery of the work, and the context surrounding it.

Context switching as we stop one piece of work and start another isn't free. In fact, switching between different streams of work takes time, reduces our effectiveness, and can result in mental fatigue.

What we call multitasking should, according to the late Stanford neuroscientist Clifford Nass, be called "multi-switching", because the human brain does not have the capacity to focus on several tasks at once. If you are multitasking, you're simply switching back and forth between tasks very quickly, and the evidence suggests that only 2% of people are good at multi-switching.

A study by Nass found that [**media multitasking is associated with negative social well-being and social indicators**](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2012-02084-001), and there's also some evidence that [**multitasking may weaken cognitive ability**](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.0903620106).

As the diagram below shows, every interruption or task switch has a cognitive cost, and the impact of having too much Work in Progress (WIP) can be seen at multiple levels: as individuals, as teams, within a domain or division, or across the organization as a whole. People are very busy but they struggle to get things done.

Limiting the amount of work in progress reduces cognitive load and boosts productivity. The problem is that's counterintuitive, especially to most managers who are under pressure to deliver a huge amount of work. The result is the desire for everyone to be busy, but, if you optimize for busy people, you get busy people, and busy people, more often than not, are stressed and inefficient.

## The Maths

The more work you add in progress, the longer your cycle time will be. This is demonstrated by Little's Law, which comes from queuing theory - the mathematical study of waiting lines, or queues. Little's law states that, in general, the more things you work on at once, the longer it will take to finish those things. Although the law is dependent on a stable system with little variability in work size.

To deliver faster, you can limit your work in progress, or you can increase your throughput, which typically involves adding more people. Although based on [**Brooks's Law**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s%20law), adding people to a project does not automatically speed up the delivery, and if the project is already late, doing so typically makes it later.

Also from queuing theory is the Kingman's Formula which demonstrates that the higher your utilization, the longer your queue, and the higher your variation, the longer your queue. Crucially these two factors are not added but multiplied with one another, so while a high value in each is not good, a high value in both is even worse.

Again, limiting work in progress to improve delivery efficiency is far easier than reducing variation, especially with knowledge work. Again however, this is counterintuitive and most managers are inclined to maximize utilization due to the pressure to deliver lots of work.

## Implementing WIP Limits

Implementing work in progress limits, or WIP limits, is a way of limiting work in progress by setting a maximum amount of work that can exist in a state.

For example, if you had a team of 5, you might limit the amount of things being worked on to 7, meaning that no more than 7 items can be in progress at any one time, and no new work can be started until one item in progress has been moved on, to another state, in the process.

By limiting work in progress and ensuring there is some slack in your system, you optimize flow. And, having less work in progress in your system results in shorter cycle times, which enables completed, valuable work to get to customers more quickly.

This ability to deliver value to customers and clients more quickly also enables us to get feedback more quickly -- such that it can influence what we do next. It's a virtuous cycle that allows us to learn and improve.

The diagram below shows WIP limits on a Kanban board -- with a maximum of 3 items allowed in the "To Do" column, and only 2 in the "In Progress" column. This is something that can be implemented in Azure DevOps (ADO) and is something many teams find helpful.

![Kanban board example](Limit%20Work%20In%20Progress_media/media/image4.png)

Visualizing work using a Kanban board helps monitor the amount of WIP and prevents WIP limits being breached. It also shows when work is accumulating and causing a bottleneck.

WIP Limits are often used in conjunction with a [**definition of 'Done'**](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/87fd8010-884c-426f-a99c-58b8fbe17df8.aspx) which helps ensure that work meets a certain standard or level of completeness. This helps ensure work does not return to the system for rework.

The combination of these two techniques helps ensure a balance between completing work and delivering work that's of the right quality.

## Reducing Waste in the Pursuit of Greater Efficiency

WIP is a form of waste and reducing it is important in the pursuit of greater efficiency and agility. Work in progress delays the return on investment, hides defects, and reduces transparency, while reducing WIP helps identify areas that can be improved.

As an example, reducing the amount of work in progress may expose periods of idle time, where a team or individual has no work in progress, and the root cause of this can then be investigated.

## In Summary

1. WIP limits help teams to focus on completing work before starting new work.
2. WIP limits reduce the amount of work in progress, which can help to identify and resolve bottlenecks in the development process.
3. WIP limits increase collaboration and communication within teams, as team members must work together to prioritize work and keep work-in-progress within the limit.
4. WIP limits can help to reduce the risk of delays and missed deadlines, as teams are better able to manage their workload and prevent overload.
5. WIP limits can improve team morale by reducing the amount of time spent on multitasking and context switching, which can lead to frustration and burnout.
6. WIP limits require ongoing monitoring and adjustment to ensure that they remain effective and aligned with team goals and priorities.
