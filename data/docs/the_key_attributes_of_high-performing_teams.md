# The Key Attributes of High-Performing Teams

In today's fast-paced and ever-changing business world, organizations need to be agile, adaptable, and innovative to stay ahead of the competition. One of the keys to achieving this is to establish and maintain high-performing teams. These are teams that not only achieve exceptional results but also foster an environment that supports team members' growth and development, collaborate effectively, and have a sense of purpose and fulfillment in their work. In this article, we'll explore the key attributes of high-performing teams and provide practical tips and strategies for creating them.



## What are High-Performing Teams?

According to Lyssa Adkins, an experienced agile coach and [**author**](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/8337919), high-performing teams are characterized by the following attributes:

1. **Trust** - High-performing teams trust each other and have an environment of [**psychological safety**](https://my.schroders.com/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/aa3752ff-4edf-4889-a690-516f1cd2755c.aspx), where members feel comfortable sharing ideas, giving feedback, and asking for help.

2. **Shared Purpose** - The team has a clear and compelling vision that everyone is aligned with, and understands the [**larger impact of their work**](https://my.schroders.com/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/f5a15f2e-81de-4ec6-b29f-920bccd23e46.aspx).

3. **Effective Communication** - The team communicates openly and effectively, using active listening and constructive feedback.

4. **Continuous Learning** - Members of a high-performing team are always [**learning and growing**](https://my.schroders.com/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/11323923-036e-4eb7-9d15-12856e7b2a0b.aspx), seeking new knowledge and skills, and [**sharing what they learn with others**](https://my.schroders.com/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/1e4126b8-0149-4a6d-b376-e207a2ef2712.aspx).

5. **Self-organization** - High-performing teams are self-organizing, with each member taking responsibility for their own work and contributing to the overall success of the team.

## The Challenges of Creating and Sustaining High-Performing Teams

Creating and sustaining high-performing teams is not easy, and there are many challenges that organizations may face along the way. These can include:

- Conflicting personalities and communication styles

## Tips for Building and Sustaining High-Performing Teams

While creating high-performing teams may be challenging, it is not impossible. Here are some tips that we can use:

- **Set Clear Goals and Expectations**: High-performing teams need to have a clear sense of purpose and direction. Set SMART goals and communicate them effectively to team members.

- **Foster Open and Honest Communication**: Create a culture of trust and psychological safety, where team members feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and ideas, giving feedback, and asking for help.

- **Encourage Continuous Learning and Development**: Provide opportunities for team members to learn and grow, and create a culture of continuous improvement and feedback.

- **Empower Team Members to Make Decisions**: High-performing teams are self-organizing, with each member taking responsibility for their own work and contributing to the overall success of the team. Encourage autonomy and decision-making at all levels of the team.

- **Celebrate Successes**: Recognize and celebrate the successes of the team, and acknowledge the contributions of individual team members.

## Things to Consider

The rest of this article will expand on these and explore some of the peripheral factors which support the evolution of teams to high performance.

### Correctly Sized

The size of a team can have a significant impact on its effectiveness and productivity.

Research suggests that the optimal size for a team is between five and nine members. This way, teams can be more agile and flexible, with fewer communication barriers and a greater sense of camaraderie while still maintaining a wide range of skills and perspectives, which can lead to greater creativity and innovation. It's important to consider the purpose and goals of the team when determining its size, as well as the people available and communication channels. Ultimately, the ideal team size will depend on the specific needs, context, and circumstance.

### Cross-Functional

One factor that contributes to the success of high-performing teams is cross-functionality. A cross-functional team is a group of people with diverse skills and expertise who work together to achieve a common goal. The team members are not only specialists in their own area of work but also have a general understanding of the other areas of work within the team. This allows them to work collaboratively and contribute to the overall success of the team.

For example, a cross-functional M&A team could include financial experts, legal experts, HR experts, tech experts, marketing experts, and operations experts. By bringing together a team with a broad range of skills and knowledge, all aspects of the M&A transaction are managed effectively and efficiently with reduced handoffs and a consideration of other points of view which can reduce bottlenecks and misalignment later in the process.

By bringing together people with different skills and perspectives, cross-functional teams are better equipped to solve complex problems and create innovative solutions. Because the team members have a broad range of skills, they can adapt to new situations and take on new responsibilities more easily.

### Business Aligned

By aligning team objectives with the [**organization's strategic goals and customer needs**](https://my.schroders.com/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/f5a15f2e-81de-4ec6-b29f-920bccd23e46.aspx), teams can build high-quality products that solve real problems and provide value to customers. This alignment leads to improved product quality, customer satisfaction, and team morale, resulting in higher engagement, motivation, and productivity.

When a team understands how their work fits into the broader business context and how it contributes to the organization's success, they are more likely to feel a sense of purpose and ownership over their work. This sense of ownership and purpose can lead to a positive impact on the team's motivation and productivity.

### Product-Centered

When a team takes ownership of a product, they feel a sense of accountability for its success, which motivates them to deliver a high-quality product that meets the customer's needs.

A team that takes ownership is focused on the long-term success of the product, considering how it will evolve over time and remain useful to its users. This focus can lead to more strategic decision-making and a more successful product.

In contrast, working with a project mindset means that the team is focused on delivering a specific project within a set timeframe and budget. They may not be as invested in the long-term success of the product or the impact it has on the customer, leading to a lack of ownership and accountability, and ultimately, a lower-quality product.

## Tuckman's Model of Team Development

One of the most widely recognized models of team development is the Tuckman Model, developed by psychologist Bruce Tuckman in 1965. This model describes the four stages of team development: forming, storming, norming, and performing.

- **Forming**: when the team is first established and members are getting to know each other.

- **Storming**: conflicts and disagreements may arise as team members work through different perspectives and approaches.

- **Norming**: the team begins to establish norms and expectations for how they will work together.

- **Performing**: the team is able to work together effectively and achieve high levels of productivity and success.

It's important to note that the Tuckman Model is not necessarily linear, and teams may cycle through the stages multiple times as they face new challenges or changes.

## Google's Project Aristotle

In 2012, Google launched [**Project Aristotle**](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/understanding-team-effectiveness/steps/introduction/), a two-year study aimed at identifying the key factors that contribute to high-performing teams.

The study analyzed data from hundreds of Google teams across a variety of functions and industries, using a combination of surveys, interviews, and performance metrics. The researchers identified five key factors that are common to high-performing teams, which include psychological safety, dependability, structure and clarity, meaning, and impact.

These factors align with what we have discussed in this article, such as establishing clear goals and expectations, fostering open and honest communication, and encouraging continuous learning and development. Google also places a strong emphasis on continuous learning and development.

## Conclusion

Building and sustaining high-performing teams is crucial for organizations that want to stay ahead of the competition and achieve exceptional results.

High-performing teams are characterized by trust, shared purpose, effective communication, continuous learning, and self-organization. Organizations can achieve this by setting clear goals and expectations, fostering open and honest communication, encouraging continuous learning and development, empowering team members to make decisions, and celebrating successes. By doing so, organizations can create a culture of excellence that benefits both the team members and the organization as a whole.
