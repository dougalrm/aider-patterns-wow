# Nurturing the Right Environment (Developing Psychological Safety)

****

When employees feel comfortable asking for help, sharing ideas and suggestions, or challenging the status quo without fear of negative social consequences, organisations are more likely to innovate quickly, unlock the benefits of diversity, and adapt well to change. This is the premise for developing Psychological Safety.

## What is Psychological Safety?

The concept of individual Psychological Safety was first introduced by Schein and Bennis in 1965. They discussed the need for psychological safety for individuals to feel secure and capable of changing. Their work has served as the basis for research since then.

Psychological Safety was popularised by **[Google's Project Aristotle](https://rework.withgoogle.com/print/guides/5721312655835136/)**, where they utilised the research of Dr. Amy Edmondson to investigate what conditions produce the optimal environment for effective teams.

Edmondson not only codified the concept:

> "The belief that one will not be punished or humiliated for speaking up with ideas, questions, concerns, or mistakes, and the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking."

She also provided the first---and most commonly used---instrument for measuring psychological safety. Edmondson asked team members how strongly they agreed or disagreed with these statements:

1. If you make a mistake on this team, it is often held against you.

2. Members of this team are able to bring up problems and tough issues.

3. People on this team sometimes reject others for being different.

4. It is safe to take a risk on this team.

5. It is difficult to ask other members of this team for help.

6. No one on this team would deliberately act in a way that undermines my efforts.

7. Working with members of this team, my unique skills and talents are valued and utilized.

This is run as a team survey. A low set of results indicates potential interpersonal issues within your team. If you get a set of weak results, you can use this exercise as an opportunity to discuss the concept of psychological safety.

## Why is Psychological Safety Important and What are the Benefits?

When employees perceive psychological safety in the workplace, they tend to:

- Speak up more often and openly.

- Share their views and ideas with their managers.

- Feed their opinions to influence decision making in their teams.

When people ask questions, share mistakes, and listen to different perspectives, they're more likely to learn important lessons and gain deeper insight. This translates into company innovation, growth, and personal development.

In the study shown below, the positive impact is clear.

Just as important as defining what psychological safety is, is to be clear about what it isn't.

- Psychological safety is not the goal but a means to the goal. It is a tool to achieve greater team effectiveness, collaboration, innovation, or even inclusion.

- It is not about being 'nice'. We all need to be respectful of one another and still challenge ideas and ways of working. It allows for 'productive disagreement'.

- Acceptance of all ideas. Your voice is valued, and ideas should be shared and discussed, but we must be prepared for some ideas not being adopted.

- It does not replace trust. While closely linked, trust is about our expectation of one individual of another (we trust another person because they always do as they say they will) or of an organisation (we trust specific brands).

- It is not about lowering any of our standards. In fact, having psychological safety allows teams to perform to a higher standard.

## How Do We Develop Psychological Safety?

In her [**TEDx talk, Edmondson offers three simple things individuals can do**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhoLuui9gX8) to foster team psychological safety:

- Frame the work as a learning problem, not an execution problem.

- Acknowledge your own fallibility.

- Model curiosity and ask lots of questions.

We can also:

- Request feedback as often as possible, particularly if you're in leadership.

- Include the team in decision-making processes.

- Avoid getting defensive or resentful when you get feedback.

- Actively listen to all ideas and concerns and respond appreciatively.

- Admit your own mistakes openly and encourage learning from them.

- Avoid dominating the conversation (particularly if you encourage everyone to participate).

- Encourage others to challenge you.

- Ask others to help you work on your growth opportunities and development areas.

- Check on team members, even from other teams.

- Ask people how you can help them develop and do their best at work.

- Become a mentor or sponsor for underrepresented employees, even from other teams.

We can build psychological safety by creating the right climate, mindsets, and behaviors within our teams. In our experience, those who do this best act as catalysts, empowering and enabling others on the team---even those with no formal authority---to help cultivate psychological safety by role modelling and reinforcing the behaviors they expect from the rest of the team.

Research finds that a positive team climate---in which team members value one another's contributions, care about one another's well-being, and have input into how the team carries out its work---is the most important driver of a team's psychological safety. Moreover, creating a positive team climate can pay additional dividends during a time of disruption.
