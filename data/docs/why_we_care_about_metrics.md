# Why We Care About Metrics



We care about metrics because the insights they provide help our technology teams to improve their performance, and technology performance drives business performance. We want teams to take the time to adopt and refine the right capabilities so that they can drive us to success.

## Technology Performance is Key to Business Performance

Technology enables pretty much everything we do and is fundamental to achieving our ambitions as a firm. Crucially, IT performance has also been shown to correlate with strong business performance, helping to boost productivity, profitability, and market share.

As such, improving our ability to deliver technology enables us to:

- Deliver valuable capabilities faster.

- Pivot & change direction when needed.

- Respond rapidly to compliance & security changes.

- Take advantage of fast feedback to satisfy customers & attract new ones.

- Retain and attract talented people.

## What Drives Development & Delivery Performance?

The capabilities that drive performance improvements in software development and delivery have been identified by a 9-year research program by the [**DevOps Research and Assessment group**](https://www.devops-research.com/research.html), known simply as 'DORA'.

It's the largest and longest-running academically rigorous research program looking at software delivery and operations, having gathered more than 30,000 survey responses from people working in various industries. You can read the most recent report findings in the 'State of DevOps Report' released yearly.

Having looked at software delivery performance, they've identified 24 key capabilities across five categories essential for any organization looking to modernize its practices and gain a competitive advantage. The five categories are:

- Continuous Delivery

- Architecture

- Product & Process

- Lean Management & Monitoring

- Culture

You can find all 24 of these capabilities and more detail on them on [the website ITrevolution.com](https://itrevolution.com/articles/24-key-capabilities-to-drive-improvement-in-software-delivery/) or in the book '[Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1942788339)', which is highly recommended.

## Teams That Take the Time to Improve Perform Vastly Better

We also know from industry research that teams that have adopted and refined the right capabilities perform vastly better than teams that haven't adopted those capabilities.

The DORA research shows that the teams revealed to be high performing:

- Deploy code 46 times more frequently.

- Are able to get work done 440 times faster.

- Can recover from downtime 170 times sooner.

- And have a failure rate for changes that's 5 times lower.

## The Value of Data & Actionable Insights

It's often said that a company's most valuable assets are its people and its data, especially data about the organization itself.

Having access to data and the insights that data provides allows us to do the following much more effectively:

- Focus our energy on the most valuable things.

- Make the right decisions at the right time.

- Identify signals of problems earlier and quantify their impact.

- Forecast with sufficient accuracy, without it being onerous.

- Identify the root cause of issues.

- Understand how well we're performing.

- Identify opportunities for improvement.

- Validate and quantify our achievements.

The key thing is that we want data and metrics that help us achieve our business objectives. It's about having access to actionable insights, at the right time, and in the right way.
