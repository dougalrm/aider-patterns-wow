title: Clear Definition of Ready

description: The "Clear Definition of Ready (CDF Pattern)" page outlines the importance of a well-defined "Definition of Ready" for agile teams to ensure that work is clear, feasible, and testable before entering an iteration. It highlights criteria such as clarity, feasibility, and testability, alongside the INVEST framework to enhance collaboration and maintain quality standards in product development.

# Clear Definition of Ready (CDF Pattern)



In order to successfully pull items into the current iteration, it is important that the work is in a state where there are no outstanding questions needed to start. We call this state 'Ready'. Pulling unfinished or unrefined work into an iteration causes problems and follows the common saying of "Rubbish in, Rubbish out".

If teams work off of insufficiently detailed or defined stories, they are unlikely to produce high-quality deliverables. Therefore, all teams must agree and capture a "Definition of Ready" that helps to ensure the work they do is of the appropriate quality. The **Definition of Ready (DoR)** is a formal description of the state which work should be in when it is ready to be pulled into an iteration. If the stories that are likely to be worked on in the next iteration aren't ready, then the team will struggle to make a realistic commitment or forecast in the planning meeting and fully meet the iteration's goal.

## Definition of Ready

The best way to ensure that the high-priority pieces of work in the backlog are ready is to work on refining the backlog together as a team. This tends to naturally lead to workable stories, as it leverages the creativity of the team, creates shared understanding and ownership, and reduces the number of story-related questions during an iteration. One way to understand if an item is 'Ready' is to consider the following criteria; it should be **clear**, **feasible**, and **testable**.

- **Clear**: A story is clear if all team members have a shared understanding of what it means. This means collaboratively writing user stories and specifically adding [acceptance criteria](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/388a414f-4b39-4a75-85ba-621264a4b949.aspx) that bring clarity. Teams that are new to this way of working will typically need more clarity, and as knowledge increases, less detail will be required.

- **Feasible**: A story is feasible if it can be realistically completed in one iteration and meet the criteria set out in the [Definition of Done](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/87fd8010-884c-426f-a99c-58b8fbe17df8.aspx). Feasible implies two things: The item must be sized appropriately, and it must not be too complex.

- **Testable**: A story is testable if there is an effective way to determine if the functionality works as expected. Quality acceptance criteria ensure that each story can be tested. As a rule of thumb, it's good to have three to five acceptance criteria per user story.

## The INVEST Criteria

A good definition of ready will ensure that each piece of work is sufficiently detailed. A common pattern to do this is to assess the user story against the following criteria using the INVEST acronym:

- "I" ndependent (of all others)

- "N" egotiable (not a specific contract for features)

- "V" aluable (or vertical)

- "E" stimable (to a good approximation)

- "S" ized appropriately / Small (so as to fit within an iteration)

- "T" estable (in principle, even if there isn't a test for it yet)

## Example Definition of Ready for a User Story

- Well-defined story\* ([Product backlog item](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/388a414f-4b39-4a75-85ba-621264a4b949.aspx) in ADO)

- Clear and understandable

- Testable

- Acceptance criteria defined

- Performance criteria identified

- Feasible and sized appropriately by the team

- The Team is able to 'demo' the user story.

\*Typically, this would be in the form of a User Story, but other methods do exist. [For a real example, here is the Definition of Ready for one of the teams in Private Assets](https://confluence.schroders.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=155527352).

The Definition of Ready is best owned jointly by the Product Lead and the team, and each team's Delivery Lead will be suitably equipped to facilitate its creation. An important consideration is to prevent the Definition of Ready from becoming too heavyweight, such that it turns into an impediment for collaboration and communication.

Benefits of a Definition of Ready are multiple: it helps the team to measure a backlog item's 'Ready' state and ensure that product backlog items have been thought through with 'just enough' refinement or prework. It also gives the team a clearly defined frame of reference to push back on stories that are ill-defined. It helps to keep the team accountable to each other regarding the required quality standard and reduces pressure on the team to commit to estimates before stories are 'Ready'.

Ultimately, the Definition of Ready represents a shared understanding of the state the work must be in before it can proceed to the next set of activities on the way to Done. The best way to feel confident that you have a shared understanding is through direct collaboration. So, the goal of establishing a Definition of Ready is actually an effort to drive collaboration.

## Further Insights

For another take on the Definition of Ready, [Mike Cohn's article talks about the downsides or negatives to look out for](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/the-dangers-of-a-definition-of-ready). This is in part why the above section doesn't focus on explicit requirements, and the Definition of Ready should allow some flexibility, within reason.
