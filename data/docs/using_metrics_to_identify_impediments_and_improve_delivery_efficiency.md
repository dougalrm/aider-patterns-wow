# Using Metrics to Identify Impediments and Improve Delivery Efficiency - Flow Metrics



Using flow metrics such as cycle time and throughput can help teams understand their delivery efficiency, and they should be used routinely to help them improve.

## The Benefits of Metrics and Flow

Flow metrics provide insights into how efficiently work flows through our end-to-end workflow process. They enable us to inspect the process so that we can identify and remove impediments -- something which can lead to significant efficiency improvements

## What are Flow Metrics?

Flow Metrics measure work as it moves through all the workflow steps. Examples of flow metrics include:

- **Cycle time**: Typically this is the elapsed time between starting work and it being completed.

- **Lead time**: The total amount of elapsed time between work being identified or requested and it being completed.

- **Throughput**: The number of work items completed within a time period.

- **Flow Efficiency**: The percentage of time active work is performed of the overall elapsed time.

- **Work in progress**: The number of work items started but not finished.

- **Work item age**: For items that are still in progress, the elapsed time since starting work.

The above metrics can be used in addition to the metrics that are mandatory to track. More on these can be found [**on the 'Tracking Key Metrics to Improve Delivery Efficiency'**](cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/4845e02e-dfaa-4cdf-88f8-a1fb4578b58a.aspx).

Metrics provide insights into where particular problems lie, but they don't tell you specifically what to fix. It's often necessary to do some root cause analysis or experimentation to get to the source of problems, and there may be several contributory factors.

When looking to optimize flow, it's important to strike the right balance between speed and quality. It's also important to measure the system end-to-end, i.e., from initial idea all the way through to release to the customer or client. [**Systems Thinking**](https://thesystemsthinker.com/introduction-to-systems-thinking/).

The speed at which work flows through the system is limited by its slowest step or constraint. Any optimizations that don't address this constraint will not produce the expected efficiency improvement. [**Theory of Constraints**](https://www.leanproduction.com/theory-of-constraints/).

Some teams have made their end-to-end analysis easier by [**ensuring their Definition of Done**](cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/87fd8010-884c-426f-a99c-58b8fbe17df8.aspx) means released to production.

## How to Use Metrics to Identify Impediments and Improve Delivery Efficiency

The first thing to do is ensure reliable data is feeding into the metrics calculations by tracking at least the [**mandatory key metrics**](cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/4845e02e-dfaa-4cdf-88f8-a1fb4578b58a.aspx), but ideally an expanded set that provide the most valuable insights.

It's then recommended that teams perform in-depth analysis of their workflow using the signals highlighted by their metrics. [Actionable Agile could be helpful here](uvdmNFbhGhzyMpGgOHA/0760f6f1-b30a-49ee-8b21-b6a913ea3014.aspx?xsdata=...), however this is an ADO extension and is only as good as the data in ADO. Configuration and filtering capability within Actionable Agile enables teams to perform interactive analysis of their workflow to identify existing inefficiencies.

The impediments to efficiency typically discovered by teams include:

- **Internal dependencies**, such as hand-offs between team members in siloed roles or with specialist skills. In this example, teams might consider taking steps to become 'T-Shaped' by pairing, and implementing the Kanban principles of Actively Managing Workflow and Controlling WIP to ensure that there is a preference for work to be completed [Kanban Guide].

- **External dependencies**, such as needing skills that are not available within the team. In this example, team members can proactively acquire these skills, perhaps via formal training.

- **Rework**, i.e., having to resolve a production defect because a new capability did not meet the business need. A potential consequence of repeated rework might be a team losing their trusted status, meaning that internal processes restrict them and take longer.

The issues identified via root-cause analysis then need to be prioritized, with those that are very frequent, and/or high impact, being targeted first.
