title: Clear Business Outcomes

description: This page explores the principle of "Clear Business Outcomes," emphasizing alignment with strategic objectives through clearly defined, measurable results. It advocates for focusing on outcomes over outputs, supported by collaboration between business and technology, and emphasizes using both qualitative and quantitative metrics to track progress and drive strategic aims effectively within agile frameworks.

# Clear Business Outcomes (CDF Principle)

## Our Five Ways of Working Principles

- People & Collaboration

- Leading by Example

- **Clear Business Outcomes**

- Stable, Empowered Teams

- Continuous Improvement

Our principles are rooted in agile values and principles. Here, we explore each principle. Remember, these are aspirational concepts that describe the place we want to reach.

## Intro

A business outcome is a concise, defined, observable result or change in business performance, supported by a specific measure. It is agnostic to solution, organizational structure, or other constraints, and articulates strategy in a measurable and achievable manner.

Feedback suggests that Schroders' focus has been on output rather than outcomes. In doing so, we risk solutioning before fully understanding the problem space. By shifting our focus to outcomes, we create space for the co-creation of more valuable products and solutions.

## Principle: Clear Business Outcomes

We value Clear Business Outcomes, which means:

- Aligning outcomes with our strategic objectives.

- Clearly defined outcomes.

- Focusing on the most valuable outcomes and tracking metrics to ensure expected value.

- Fostering close collaboration between business and technology representatives to fully understand the problem or opportunity.

To achieve our strategic outcomes, we must optimize for the fast and efficient flow of valueâ€”from initial idea through to delivery to customers. This involves considering whether we are working on the right things, are aligned to strategic goals, and adapting our work to achieve valuable outcomes. Clear business outcomes with associated metrics can assist.

## Where Are We Heading?

The 'From' statements describe our current state, and 'To' statements describe our aspirational state.

| **From** | **To** |

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| We're not sure what we are trying to achieve and not very good at measuring it. | It's clear to see how the impact of what we do helps us achieve our strategic aims. |

| Poorly defined requirements lead to sub-optimal results and rework. | Close collaboration leads to a stronger understanding of the value expected. |

| We focus on 'on-time' and 'on-budget' as use these as an indication of success. | We focus on and can track real-world qualitative and quantitative metrics. |

| It's hard to see what others are working on and what's planned for the future. | Our business outcomes and book of work are visible to everyone. |

## Problems You May Recognize

### From

1. A lack of engagement with stakeholders means poor understanding of outcomes, priorities, and problems faced by our business, leading to incomplete requirements and solutions, busy teams, and missed priorities.

2. In some areas, a weak discovery process contributes to poorly defined requirements. Problems or opportunities are not fully understood, and fewer options are explored, leading to sub-optimal solutions. This is exacerbated by a lack of product capability.

3. Our focus is on output rather than outcomes, leading to a concentration on "on-time" and "on-budget" indicators of success. Business value measurement often relies on feedback and sentiment rather than quantitative data.

4. It's difficult to see the business outcomes we are working towards and the status of our book of work, resulting in duplication of effort, siloed planning, and diminished sense of purpose.

### Where We'd Like to Get To

### To

1. Closer collaboration between business and technology to better understand desired outcomes.

2. Close collaboration between the Business Owner and Product Lead ensures true underlying business value is identified and articulated as clear business outcomes.

3. Focus on the most valuable business outcomes, recognizing "on-time" and "on-budget" as only part of the picture. We track and report real-world qualitative and quantitative metrics to ensure expected value.

4. Making business outcomes and the book of work visible to everyone results in less duplication, better planning, and increased sense of purpose.

## Enabling Clear Business Outcomes

### Impact on Strategic Aims

Measurable outcomes align execution with strategy. Strategy touches every employee and serves as an actionable way to reach company goals.

Strategic planning articulated in clear outcomes creates a single, forward-focused vision that aligns employees. By making everyone aware of company goals, how they were chosen, and what can be done to reach them, we create increased shared ownership within the organization.

We must remain agile, evolving outcomes with market and environmental challenges and opportunities. Clear communication of changes and how they better assist in achieving outcomes is necessary.

### Outcomes, Not Outputs

Features, products, and services are outputs and solutions to problems or intended outcomes. Starting with these rather than strategy and outcomes often leads to issues such as:

- A bloated product estate with lots of duplicated features.

- Difficulty prioritizing work through shared service teams or teams providing enabling work to others, as output impacts are hard to quantify or measure.

- Difficulty prioritizing work within a team, balancing different stakeholders' needs.

- High effort levels needed to coordinate dependencies without clear outcome alignment.

Measuring strategy and aligning teams through outcomes and metrics allows:

- Greater ability to reduce scope while still achieving the measurable outcome.

- Ability to prioritize work based on perceived benefit to metrics.

- Autonomy in problem solving, tooling, and solution choice, guided by outcome, not product/service.

- Greater freedom to reduce product set while achieving the same feature set.

Starting with the desired outcome helps avoid wrong solutions by choosing too early in problem understanding. Without understanding feature effectiveness through end customer use, we risk misalignment.

Focusing on outcomes and progress towards them provides insight into product and platform efficacy. Coupled with [iterative and incremental working](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/dc7c0b13-1a7a-4646-ab14-e41cf6792d17.aspx), we can change direction if metrics show desired value is unrealized.

### Qualitative and Quantitative Metrics

Outcome metrics, which could be key performance indicators (KPIs), can be both qualitative or quantitative.

- Quantitative information involves collecting and analyzing numerical data.

- Qualitative information helps understand subjective perceptions.

Limiting metrics to quantitative measures misses opportunities to pursue subtle yet influential organizational change and client mindset outcomes.

## Clear Business Outcomes and Leadership

Leaders at all levels play a pivotal role in shifting from outputs to outcomes. Ensuring a clearly articulated strategic vision helps everyone understand direction and purpose.

Leaders ensure suitable rigor in defining business outcomes that align with strategy. Collaboration across organizational boundaries and establishing shared incentives are crucial for achieving outcomes.
