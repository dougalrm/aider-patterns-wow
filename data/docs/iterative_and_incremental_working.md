# Iterative & Incremental Working





Agile development is based on iterative and incremental development of a product or initiative. Rather than preplanning everything, small, incremental plans are created and executed upon with feedback in between.

The basic idea behind this method is to develop a product or initiative through repeated cycles (iterative) and in smaller portions at a time (incremental). This allows the team to take advantage of what was learned during the development of earlier parts or versions of the product or initiative.

Work always stops at the end of the iteration and progress is reviewed. The next iteration starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous one.

During each iteration, design modifications are made, and new functional capabilities are added based on changing requirements and the learning that comes from both the development and use of the product or initiative.

Iterative and incremental development methods are complementary in nature, which is why they are often used together to boost their efficacy.

## What is Iterative & Incremental Working

Although these two terms are frequently used as if they were a single concept, they are actually distinct from one another. To fully understand the incremental and iterative development process, you must first split it into its two parts:

- **Incremental**: An incremental process is one in which products are built and delivered in pieces. This means we break the development process down into small, manageable portions known as increments, and each increment builds on the previous version so that improvements are made step by step. This follows the principle 'Build some of it before you build all of it'. We build some of it, learn how it works in combination with the whole, then adapt based on what we learn before we build more of it.

- **Iterative**: An iterative process is one that makes progress through successive refinement. That means development activities are systematically repeated in cycles known as iterations, and a new version is produced after each iteration until the optimal product is achieved. We use multiple passes to improve what we are building so that we can converge on a good solution, as we're likely to get things wrong before we get things right and that we will do things poorly before we do them well.

Incremental development gives us important information that allows us to adapt our development effort and to change how we proceed. The biggest drawback is that by building in pieces, we risk missing the big picture.

Iterative development is an excellent way to improve a product that is being developed. The biggest downside is that, in the presence of uncertainty, it can be difficult upfront to determine or plan how many improvement passes will be necessary.

Combining the two, we can attempt to leverage the benefits whilst negating the downsides. Agile methods are iterative in that they plan for the work of one iteration to be improved upon in subsequent iterations. And they are incremental because completed work is delivered throughout the development.

## How

Below we detail some of the key characteristics that we follow when working in an iterative and incremental way. For simplicity, we will use the example of Scrum as our agile framework and use the term Sprint. Generally, at Schroders, we refer to this period as an 'Iteration'.

### Iteration Cycles

Within [Scrum](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/YASyWyZ006UdMmjiDSgqSQ/1afe113f-f808-4f9a-b97e-9b592e82d061.aspx), we organize the work into iteration cycles of up to a calendar month called Sprints. Sprints are rooted in the concept of timeboxing, a time-management technique that helps organize the performance of work and manage scope.

Each sprint takes place in a fixed-length time frame with a specific start and end date, usually lasting between 1 and 4 weeks, and is consistent in length once decided. During each of these fixed-length time frames, teams plan their work, do their work, demonstrate what they've done, and also hold a retrospective to look for ways to improve going forward.

Working in sprints is important for several reasons (NB: you can substitute 'Sprint' for any term related to this concept such as iteration or timebox):

- **Establishes a WIP (work in progress) limit**: WIP represents an inventory of work that is started but not yet finished. Because the team will plan to work on only those items that it believes it can start and finish within the sprint, timeboxing establishes a WIP limit each sprint.

- **Forces prioritization**: A fixed timebox forces us to prioritize and perform the small amount of work that matters most. This sharpens our focus on getting something valuable done quickly.

- **Demonstrates progress**: A fixed timebox also helps us demonstrate relevant progress by completing and validating important pieces of work by a known date (the end of the sprint). This type of progress reduces risk by shifting the focus away from unreliable forms of progress reporting, such as conformance to plan. It also helps stakeholders and the team learn exactly what remains to be done.

- **Avoids unnecessary perfectionism**: At one time or another, we have all spent too much time trying to get something "perfect" or to do "gold plating" when "good enough" would suffice. Timeboxing forces an end to potentially unbounded work by establishing a fixed end date for the sprint by which a good solution must be done.

- **Motivates closure**: A fixed timebox also motivates closure, the end of the sprint brings with it a hard deadline that encourages team members to diligently apply themselves to complete the work on time. Without a known end date, there is less of a sense of urgency to complete the job.

- **Improves predictability**: Although we can't predict with great certainty exactly the work we will complete a year from now, it is completely reasonable to expect that we can predict the work we can complete in the next sprint. Repeated cycles of activity also help teams to focus and bring consistency to their work.

This work cycle shows the typical stages of our operations. Here's how different aspects fit into this cycle:

- Prior to the iteration beginning, we create possible Product Backlog Items.

- Requirements are iteratively recorded and refined.

- Product Backlog Items are sized appropriately according to our previous knowledge and metrics.

- Items are prioritized for development against other Product Backlog Items.

- A set number of Product Backlog Items are planned for inclusion in an upcoming iteration according to our WIP limit.

- Product Backlog Items are developed during an iteration.

- The same number of Product Backlog Items are completed during that same iteration.

- These items are demonstrated to our customer at the end of the iteration.

## Why

Iterative and incremental development is modeled around a gradual increase in feature additions and a cyclical release and upgrade pattern. Incremental development ensures that the team can make changes early on in the process rather than waiting until the end when the allotted time has run out and the money has often been spent. Iterative development means improvements are made on an ongoing basis, so the end result is likely to be delivered on time and be of higher quality.

Working in this manner also has many benefits:

- **Eases planning**: Short durations make it easier to plan. It is easier to plan a few weeks' worth of work than six months' worth. Also, planning on such short time horizons requires far less effort and is far more accurate than longer-horizon planning.

- **Fast feedback**: Short durations generate fast feedback. During each iteration, we create completed work and then have the opportunity to inspect and adapt what we built and how we built it. Fast feedback also allows us to more quickly uncover and exploit time-sensitive emergent opportunities.

- **Improved return on investment/value**: Short durations allow for early and more frequent deliverables. As a result, we have the opportunity to generate revenue and realize value sooner, improving the overall return.

- **Limited errors**: Short durations prevent large errors, even if everything developed in that iteration was wrong, due to the frequent coordination, collaboration, and feedback, it will only be wrong in a small way.

- **Retained enthusiasm**: Short durations keep participant excitement high by delivering working assets frequently. If we work on a very long-duration project, not only are we more likely to fail; we are also more likely to eventually lose enthusiasm for the effort.

- **Frequent checkpoints**: At the end of each short iteration, there is a meaningful checkpoint that allows everyone to base decisions on demonstrable, working features. People are better able to deal with a complex environment when they have more opportunities to inspect and adapt.

Probably the largest benefit to short-length iteration is **risk reduction and management**. Short durations provide greater transparency, improve predictability, and control risk. Agile development, due to its iterative nature, implicitly makes risk management a part of the life cycle. With a regular cadence and frequent delivery, the team is capable of putting something into the hands of users on a regular basis and getting feedback that can be used to course-correct or tackle specific risk events quicker and more effectively. More specifically, it does this in several ways, including:

- Ensuring work is broken down small enough to fit in the iteration length.

- Ensuring work is well understood by the whole team.

- The product or platform is continually improved until the objectives are met or risk is reduced.

- Showing the work that's been completed (done) to the customer to get their feedback.

- Events such as daily stand-ups, planning, reviews, and retrospectives prompt discussion and feedback.

Iterative and incremental processes are a fundamental part of lean and agile methods, but they can be implemented by any team.

### A Structured Approach for Managing Risk

In an agile environment, there is no need to create a formal risk management plan; the method of addressing risk is built into agile procedures. The only decision the team may need to make is whether to conduct risk management activities overtly or organically.

In an agile environment:

- **Risk Identification**: The whole team does this exercise on an iterative basis. The results influence the work that is being planned for that iteration.

- **Risk Analysis**: Qualitative analysis using judgment, intuition, and experience in determining risks and potential losses. Short development cycles and constant reviews in Agile make this feasible and effective. This is different from traditional projects where quantitative analysis is done, and numbers are assigned to the damage which can occur.

- **Risk Response Planning**: The entire team participates in developing options and actions to reduce threats.

- **Risk Monitoring and Controlling**: Risk is monitored, and controlling strategies are discussed at the end of each iteration. Risks are monitored on a daily basis too by using information radiators.
