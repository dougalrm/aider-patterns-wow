# Resource Efficiency vs Flow Efficiency

Productivity and efficiency are important aspects for success but also ones with the potential to be problematic.

## A Good Culture and Environment

A good culture and environment is where:

- Individuals feel engaged, valued, and heard, while simultaneously delivering results for the organisation.

- Encouraging people to not only spot problems but also take action to overcome them whilst not having a noticeable decrease in pace at which they can deliver new work.

## Building Blocks for Success

There are building blocks that can help achieve results while keeping people at the core of processes and practices. Two of these are the approach and mindset around **Resource Efficiency** and **Flow Efficiency**.

### Understanding Resource Efficiency and Flow Efficiency

**Resource Efficiency**, or "people efficiency", is a measure of the utilisation and productivity of individuals. The focus here is to ensure each team member is continually engaged with tasks and features. This is "busy-ness" or "utilisation". Ideally, we want everyone in the organisation to be utilised doing productive work -- all the time!

**Flow Efficiency** is about examining how work progresses through a team and an organisation. It\'s less about where the work is happening but more about where the work isn\'t happening! Flow efficiency is a measure of the "wait time" for a piece of work. So, it's the ratio of the time waiting and time worked on, with the sum of both times equalling the "cycle time" (or "lead time" depending on your measure) of a piece of work.

While both types of efficiency are desirable, an important question arises: Which one should be prioritised?

### The Impact of Prioritising Resource Efficiency

Teams and organisations often prioritise Resource Efficiency. They plan "to capacity", aiming to utilise everyone in the team as close to 100% capacity as possible. The worry is, "What do people do when they run out of work?"

This is a natural assumption. People are paid to "do work", so keeping them busy seems optimal.

However, due to natural bottlenecks throughout all work processes, this can lead to:

- Queues of work on team boards

- Increased context switching

- Delayed feedback

- Slower work progression, delaying the release of value to stakeholders and our business

From a broader perspective, this approach can result in long cycle times (and therefore longer lead times), work building up across the team's board, busy-ness, lack of improvement activities, and a significant amount of time spent managing work queues.

This combined means that the ratio of work being done to work waiting is usually larger than you might perceive by looking at the team's work. The measurement of this time allows you to calculate and understand Flow Efficiency.

### The Benefits of Prioritising Flow Efficiency First

When Flow Efficiency is prioritised, the focus shifts to the stakeholders' perspectives. While this won\'t solve problems on its own, it exposes them, enabling proactive action. Some of the benefits that emerge include:

- Shorter end-to-end ticket times

- Exposure of system problems and bottlenecks

- Increased collaboration between roles and skill sets cross-team

- Increased team engagement and improved team practices

- Increased connection to improvement activities such as retrospectives and reviews

Teams that prioritise Flow Efficiency share these principles:

- Keep the work busy, not the people

- Focus on the overall flow of the work â€” that is: lowering the cycle & lead times of every piece of work

- Embrace the idea that everything can be improved

Adopting these principles adds more value in ways that could not be predicted or planned for upfront.

## The Outcomes of a Flow Efficiency First Approach

There are many positive outcomes to emphasising Flow Efficiency:

- Enhanced collaboration across the team

- Faster feedback from within the team and from stakeholders

- Quicker end-to-end times (Lead / Cycle Times)

- Problems surface, enabling the team to address them effectively

- Faster delivery, enabling quicker and more effective iterations of work

- Sustainable change with people at the heart of the process

This approach is not about making people work harder; it\'s about identifying and addressing what stops the work from flowing to "Done", and focusing on making things better for both the work and the people.

*The analogy is to focus on the ball and not the player.*

By prioritising Flow Efficiency, we can create an environment that values individuals while delivering tangible results.
