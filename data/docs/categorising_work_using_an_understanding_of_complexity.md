# Categorising Work Using an Understanding of Complexity (Cynefin)



## Introduction

When faced with a problem, most assume that all they need to do is elaborate on the options, select one, and then execute. This assumes that causality, when we can relate cause and effect, of the problem is determinable and therefore we have a valid means of eliminating options until the correct one remains. However, this is not always the case.

Within Schroders, the type of work we do varies significantly. This context is important because it influences the ways of working we will use to deliver our business outcomes. Typically, the work falls into one of three categories or 'domains': Complex, Complicated, or Clear. These are covered in detail below.

It's worth recognizing that different processes will fit different types of work, but identifying which process to choose is challenging. The Cynefin framework aims to assist us in identifying the type of work which will help inform the most appropriate delivery approach.

## An Overview of the Cynefin Framework

A useful model for categorizing work, the Cynefin Framework (pronounced "ku-nev-in"), helps classify problems into domains of work corresponding to the different levels of complexity that they present.

Categorizing knowledge work into types of complexity helps us understand the nature of the problems we are trying to solve, and crucially, ensures we apply the right approach to solving them.

### The Five Domains

The Cynefin framework has five domains; one in the middle, plus four others:

- **Confusion**

- **Clear**

- **Complicated**

- **Complex**

- **Chaos**

The framework is usually depicted with a cliff-edge between the *Clear* domain and the *Chaotic* domain. The reason for this is that without appropriate care and consideration, it's easy for a problem to descend into *Chaos* -- and it's important to safeguard against this.

### Ordered vs. Unordered Domains

- **Ordered Domains**: On the right side, where stuff is largely knowable and predictable, and problems are solvable (Clear and Complicated). These are distinguished by the number of interactions-- the more parts in the system, the more Complicated it is -- and the greater the level of expertise required to know the answer to a problem.

- **Unordered Domains**: On the left side, where situations are unknowable and unpredictable. This is the world of Complexity and Chaos, distinguished by the way the system changes, self-organises, and creates emergent phenomena.

## The Domains in Detail

### Clear

In the Clear domain, the relationship between cause and effect exists, is predictable, repeatable, and can be determined in advance. These relationships are obvious and can be determined simply, any constraints are fixed and known. For a given problem in this domain, we sense the problem, fit it into a category, and respond with a standard solution. This leads to true best practice solutions at any given point in time.

### Complicated

If the problem sits in the Complicated domain, it requires the help of specialists or experts to derive a solution. The solution can generally be known in advance through planning and analysis, and the result can be predicted with reasonable accuracy at the outset. Solving large problems of this nature is achieved efficiently by grouping specialists together to optimize for knowledge and consistency.

### Complex

If a problem sits in the Complex domain, the solution cannot be predicted in advance because the act of solving the problem changes the problem itself. Cause and effect are only obvious after the event.

### Chaos

In Chaos, the absence of constraints means nothing makes much sense, and all you can do is choose a place to act, apply constraints, and quickly sense what comes next.

### Confusion

'Confused' refers to the state of mind where you don't yet understand the problem. This is the default domain for situations where we do not know what type of problem we are facing.

## As a Whole

The further you go anticlockwise, the more unordered and unstable the system is. If you go clockwise, you introduce stability and order to the system. Stability lies clockwise of where you are now and instability lies anticlockwise.

Constraints in complexity can be quite tight and still contribute to emergence and creative action. Generally speaking, if you need to learn something or discover new things, loosen constraints. If you need to stabilize a situation, tighten constraints.

## Applying the Framework

One meaning of the Welsh word 'Cynefin' is "places or habitats of multiple belonging." The name of the framework references the fact that in any situation of confusion, you are likely to have all five types of problems or systems at play.

### Steps for Categorization

- If the aspect is clear and obvious, and there is a best practice, place it bottom right.

- If it has a knowable answer but requires an expert, put it top right.

- If there are many different possible approaches, and you can't be sure what will work, put it top left.

- If it's a total crisis, put it bottom left.

- If you can't figure out where it belongs, leave it in the middle until you know more.

## Which Tool for the Job?

Agile ways of working are most suitable for emergent work as they allow us to probe, sense, and respond to changes in environment, need, and/or constraints. Complicated problems require different methods than complex ones.
