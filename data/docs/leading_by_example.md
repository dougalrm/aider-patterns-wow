title: Leading by Example

description: This page delves into the "Leading by Example" principle, highlighting the shift from traditional leadership to agile leadership. It emphasizes creating psychological safety, fostering innovation, and providing constructive feedback. Leaders are encouraged to embody agile mindsets and practices, transforming themselves, teams, and the organization to achieve better outcomes and collaboration.

# Leading by Example

![Image](Leading%20by%20Example_media/media/image1.jpeg)



Our five ways of working principles are:

- People & Collaboration

- **Leading by Example**

- Clear Business Outcomes

- Stable, Empowered Teams

- Continuous Improvement

Our principles are rooted in the agile values and principles. Here we take each principle in turn and explore what it means. It's worth remembering that these are aspirational concepts that describe the place we want to get to.

## Intro

### Leading by Example

To succeed in [achieving our outcomes](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/YASyWyZ006UdMmjiDSgqSQ/481855c1-f699-480e-8805-cea97f7b0939.aspx) we will need leaders that take people on a path that challenges the status quo.

Leaders in an agile organisation serve the people in the organisation, empowering and developing them. Rather than planners, directors, and controllers, agile leaders act as visionaries, architects, and coaches that empower people to help them develop the most relevant competencies so they can lead, collaborate, and deliver exceptional results.

## Principle: Leading by Example

We value Leading by Example. This means:

- We trust our teams to come up with the best solutions.

- We ensure there is a high degree of psychological safety.

- Learning and innovation are highly valued.

- Leaders have the skills and courage to give timely and constructive feedback.

- Leaders work together and have the tenacity to address systemic blockers that impact teams.

- Everyone, including our leaders, values and benefits from consistent good practices and ways of working.

## Where are we heading?

Leading by Example comes from a desire to improve in a number of areas. The 'From' statements below describe where some of us are today (you might recognise these), while the 'To' statements describe where we want to get to in the future. Below we have expanded on each of these to give more insight.

| **From** | **To** |

|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Leaders expect others to change without changing themselves. | Leaders lead by example, demonstrating new ways of working themselves. |

| There's a lack of psychological safety. | We create an environment where employees feel psychologically safe. |

| Constant time and delivery pressures stifle innovative approaches to problem solving. | Leaders see the need for, and encourage innovative problem solving. |

| Feedback is an afterthought and we are often too busy or unequipped to notice. | Feedback enables us to approach things differently and see alternative perspectives. |

| Organisational blockers and impediments slow progress. | Leaders take actions to ensure the team don't run up against blockers. |

### Problems you may recognise

**From**

1. Rigorous, modern ways of working are generally seen as something that only matters at the team level. This means that senior people and leaders expect other people to change, but do not always demonstrate that they themselves are willing to change.

2. There's a lack of psychological safety which means that people, even senior people, don't always feel comfortable raising concerns, asking questions, or putting forward ideas, and are sometimes reluctant to acknowledge when they don't know something.

3. Constant time and delivery pressures mean that we rarely see the benefits from innovation and appropriate risk-taking.

4. Important development conversations may not happen because leaders are sometimes unable to notice that a colleague needs guidance, or they lack the skills or experience to provide constructive coaching or feedback.

5. Teams often struggle with systemic impediments and barriers that slow their progress or make collaboration difficult.

### Where we'd like to get to

Our leaders lead by example - setting the bar high and taking the time to learn and refine the same good practices and ways of working used by the agile delivery teams. This means that we all have a shared understanding of how and why it's beneficial to work this way.

1. Leaders create and nurture an environment throughout the organisation in which people feel comfortable raising concerns, asking questions, putting forward ideas, and admitting when they don't know something.

2. Leaders ensure that there is capacity built into delivery timeframes for teams to experiment with prototypes and different solutions, enabling them to learn and to "fail fast". Leaders also give engineers, designers, and others the confidence to do this by explicitly communicating the benefits of this type of innovation.

3. Leaders have the skills and situational awareness to give timely and constructive feedback - helping those around them to see alternative perspectives, approach things differently, and overcome challenges.

4. Leaders take action to address systemic impediments to progress and barriers to effective collaboration.

## Enabling Leading by Example

Leaders lead, rather than simply support the pursuit of our outcomes. They do this by creating the right environment, preparing people, and providing the necessary resources to realise our intended aims.

To build and lead an agile organisation, it's crucial that we develop new mind-sets and capabilities to transform ourselves, our teams, and our organisation.

### Transforming yourself

One of the most important and effective technique for driving the changes we need, is to internalise and demonstrate the behaviours and mindsets of business agility so that others can learn and grow by our example.

We take onboard and embed the new ways of working in our beliefs, decisions, responses, actions, and language. Through our words and actions, we demonstrate these patterns of expected behaviours. The combination of these patterns determines our culture, whether good or bad.

Changing our mindset, or adjusting it to the new context is no easy task but we must make the mindset shift from the traditional 'reactive' to the more agile 'pro-active'. This may involve a significant amount of letting go of old beliefs.

### Transforming our teams

How do we help teams work in an agile way?

- First, leaders must learn to build teams that are small, diverse, empowered, and connected.

- Second, leaders must allow and encourage agile teams to work in rapid iterations to enable them to deliver greater value more efficiently and more quickly.

- Third, leaders must keep agile teams focused on the customer (external or internal) and on creating value for them, by understanding and addressing their unmet, and potentially even unrecognized, needs.

Understanding each of these is paramount to our success. If as leaders we are not focusing on enabling our teams in this way we will not achieve our outcomes.

Each team needs to be effective at delivering outcomes and creating value. As leaders, we need to help support teams to pursue innovation and use creative problem solving at every opportunity. We need to seek new ways to meet the needs of our customers.

### Transforming our organisation

No one person can transform our organisation, it's a responsibility shared by everyone. We must translate our organisational aims into a clear and compelling purpose that is shared by everyone. This purpose is developed and communicated through conversation and engagement and not just cascaded from the top.

We should use our Ways of Working principles to inform decision-making and to develop a different set of skills to the ones we commonly rely on. More specifically, leaders must learn how to deconstruct large and complex pieces of work into smaller, more granular pieces. They should work to transform existing processes into leaner ones that enable our teams rather than restrict them.
