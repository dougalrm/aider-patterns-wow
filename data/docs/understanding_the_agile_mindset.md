# Understanding the Agile Mindset

As a modern enterprise, it's important we stay agile and adapt quickly to changes in the business environment. This is where the agile mindset comes in. At its core, the agile mindset is a way of thinking that values flexibility, adaptability, and customer satisfaction.



## In This Article We Explore:

- The agile values

- The agile principles

- Creating an agile culture and the importance of leadership

- The Agile Onion

To truly adopt an agile mindset, it's important to understand the agile values and principles that make up the [**Agile Manifesto**](https://agilemanifesto.org/) and some of the changes we will need to make to our culture to fully support it.

The Agile Manifesto is the foundation of the agile mindset and is a set of guiding values and principles. It was created by a group of software developers in 2001 and through its values and principles, the Agile Manifesto provides a foundation of behaviours for Agile teams to put into practice.

## The Agile Values

### Individuals and Interactions Over Processes and Tools

The agile mindset values people over processes and tools. This means creating an environment where team members feel comfortable sharing ideas, asking questions, and collaborating with one another. It also means recognizing that people are the most important part of any project and that their skills, knowledge, and expertise are what ultimately drive success.

### Working Software Over Comprehensive Documentation

In traditional project management approaches, there is often a heavy emphasis on documentation. However, in the agile mindset, the focus is on delivering working software that meets the customer's needs. This doesn't mean that documentation isn't important, but it should be kept to a minimum and only used when necessary. This value also emphasizes the importance of continuous delivery, which allows teams to deliver value to the customer more frequently. Here the term 'software' can be substituted for products, services, or otherwise.

### Customer Collaboration Over Contract Negotiation

The agile mindset values collaboration with the customer over negotiating contracts. This means involving the customer in the development process, gathering feedback and input, and working together to ensure that the end product meets their needs. This value also emphasizes the importance of being responsive to customer feedback and adapting to their changing needs.

### Responding to Change Over Following a Plan

In today's fast-paced business environment, plans can quickly become outdated. The agile mindset emphasizes the importance of being able to respond to change quickly and effectively. This means being open to feedback, adapting to new information, and making changes as needed. This value also emphasizes the importance of continuous improvement, which allows teams to learn from their mistakes and make changes to improve their processes over time.

By understanding these values and what they mean, you can begin to adopt an agile mindset within your team.

## The Agile Principles

The Agile Principles are a set of guiding behaviours that underpin the Agile Manifesto. They provide a practical framework for teams to work collaboratively and deliver high-quality products that meet the needs of their customers. Here are the twelve principles:

1. **Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.**

This principle emphasizes the importance of delivering working software frequently to ensure that the customer's needs are met.

2. **Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.**

This principle acknowledges that requirements can change throughout the development process and encourages teams to embrace change as an opportunity to deliver more value to the customer.

3. **Deliver working software frequently, with a preference to the shorter timescale.**

This principle emphasizes the importance of delivering working software quickly and often, to ensure that the team is on track and that the customer's needs are being met.

4. **Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.**

This principle encourages teams to work together closely and continuously throughout the project, to ensure that everyone is aligned on goals and that any issues are addressed quickly.

5. **Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.**

This principle emphasizes the importance of having a motivated and empowered team, who are focused on delivering value to the customer.

6. **The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.**

This principle acknowledges that face-to-face communication is often the most effective way to convey information, particularly in complex or rapidly changing environments.

7. **Working software is the primary measure of progress.**

This principle emphasizes the importance of delivering working software as the primary measure of progress, rather than relying on documentation or other metrics.

8. **Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.**

This principle emphasizes the importance of maintaining a sustainable pace of work, to ensure that the team can continue to deliver value over the long term.

9. **Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.**

This principle emphasizes the importance of technical excellence and good design, which are key to ensuring that the team can deliver high-quality software that meets the customer's needs.

10. **Simplicity—the art of maximising the amount of work not done—is essential.**

This principle emphasizes the importance of keeping things simple, to avoid unnecessary complexity and ensure that the team can focus on delivering value to the customer.

11. **The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.**

This principle acknowledges that self-organizing teams are often best placed to make decisions about architecture, requirements, and design, based on their deep understanding of the problem domain.

12. **At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behaviour accordingly.**

This principle emphasizes the importance of continuous improvement, which is key to ensuring that the team can continue to deliver value over the long term.

While at a glance these principles reference software development they can equally be applied in other areas and industries. Check out the '[**Agile beyond software development**](uqe0X9ItmVZY5cwdd8a77A/99136439-0947-4f39-9815-b4662ca03af1.aspx)' article to understand more.

## Agile Culture and the Importance of Leadership

Agile values and principles create a unique culture within organizations that is characterized by trust, transparency, and communication. In an agile culture, teams are empowered to take ownership of their work, collaborate effectively, and deliver value to customers quickly and efficiently.

Agile culture is all about creating an environment that fosters collaboration, experimentation, and continuous learning. In an agile culture, everyone is accountable for the success of the project, and everyone is encouraged to speak up and share their ideas.

One of the key aspects of an agile culture is trust. Trust is built through transparency, open communication, and a willingness to admit mistakes and learn from them. When team members trust each other, they are more likely to collaborate effectively and take risks together.

Leadership plays a crucial role in fostering an agile culture. Agile leaders understand that their role is to empower teams to make decisions and take risks. They model agile values by being transparent, collaborative, and open to feedback. They also create an environment where it's safe to fail, because they know that failure is an opportunity to learn and improve.

Agile leaders also understand that their role is to remove obstacles and create a supportive environment for their teams. They provide clear goals and objectives, but they also give teams the autonomy to figure out how to achieve those goals. By doing so, they create a sense of ownership and accountability among team members, which is essential for success in an agile environment.

## The Agile Onion by Simon Powers

In 2016, Simon Powers introduced a useful model for tying the different aspects of Agile together, called the Agile Onion.

At its core, the Agile Onion is a way of visualising the different layers involved in product and software development. It emphasizes that the mindset is just as important as the tools and processes. This means that you can't fully leverage the tools without the right mindset, and vice versa. It's all about recognising that the two go hand in hand, and one isn't better than the other.

*\[Image Caption - The Agile Onion by Simon Powers, showing how mindset is least visible yet most powerful\]*

### In Summary, the Agile Onion Comprises Five Layers:

- **Tools and processes**, such as ADO, Confluence, Boards, etc. These are ineffective on their own.

- **Practices**, including user stories, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives.

- **Principles**, like in the agile manifesto, as we described earlier.

- **Values**, such as trust, respect, honesty, courage, equal voice, and safety to speak out. These are the bedrock of high-performing teams.

- **Mindset**, the way we think about how work gets done. It's recognising that transformation, product development, and software development are complex problems, not complicated ones. And understanding that managing work using traditional processes like project management in a complex environment actually makes work less predictable, not more!

By visualising the Agile Onion in this way, we can better understand the layers involved to use agile tools and practices effectively. It clearly shows how the tools and practices are supported by the values and mindset to help teams deliver value to customers and respond to change in a better way.

The onion is deliberately shaped this way as it's a Venn diagram where each circle sits inside one outside. The surface area of the circle is how important the element is. It's also important that this outer layer is where you start, much like peeling any fruit, you start with the outside, not the inside.

## Conclusion

The agile mindset is a powerful approach to improving processes, delivering value to customers, and creating a culture of continuous improvement but the hardest of all to see. By embracing agile values and principles, organisations can create an environment that empowers teams, promotes collaboration, and fosters innovation.

Adopting the agile mindset requires creating an environment that values people over processes and tools, delivering working products that meet the customer's needs, collaborating with the customer to ensure that their needs are met, and being responsive to change and continuous improvement.

As the business landscape continues to evolve, the agile mindset will become an increasingly important tool for organisations looking to stay competitive and deliver value to their customers.

## TL;DR
