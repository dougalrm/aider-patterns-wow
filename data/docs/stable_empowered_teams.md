# Stable Empowered Teams (CDF Principle)



Our five ways of working principles are:

1. People & Collaboration

2. Leading by Example

3. Clear Business Outcomes

4. **Stable, Empowered Teams**

5. Continuous Improvement

Our principles are rooted in agile values and principles. Here we take each principle in turn and explore what it means. It's worth remembering that these are aspirational concepts that describe the place we want to get to.

## Intro

To succeed in [achieving our outcomes](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/YASyWyZ006UdMmjiDSgqSQ/481855c1-f699-480e-8805-cea97f7b0939.aspx) we will need our organisation to comprise of a dense network of empowered teams that operate with high standards of alignment, accountability, expertise, transparency, and collaboration.

Networks of empowered teams are a natural way to organise people because they balance individual freedom with collective coordination. Research has shown that fatigued NASA crews that had worked extensively together made about half as many mistakes as teams of rested pilots with no prior experience working together. This is because many of the factors that relate to effective teamwork (such as shared mental models, cohesion, climate, and psychological safety) come about only in teams that have consistently worked together.

If people understand that they will stay with the same colleagues for longer periods of time, they are more likely to invest energy in creating an enjoyable team environment and improving their work processes.

## Principle: Stable, Empowered Teams

We value Stable, Empowered Teams. This means:

- Our teams are empowered to deliver the best solutions - collaborating to understand business problems, test hypotheses, and gather real-world data about what works.

- Our teams are composed of different functional expertise, which ensure that the knowledge and skills to deliver our desired outcomes.

- Our teams define the best way to reach goals, prioritise activities, and focus their effort.

- Our culture and ways of working make team members feel empowered.

- Our teams are able to take sufficient time out to learn and develop.

- Everyone understands how the work they do contributes to our overall objectives.

## Where are we heading?

Stable, Empowered Teams comes from a desire to improve in a number of areas. The 'From' statements below describe where some of us are today (you might recognise these), while the 'To' statements describe where we want to get to in the future. Below we have expanded on each of these to give more insight.

| **From** | **To** |

|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Teams are rarely involved in understanding business problems. | Team work directly with subject matter experts in the business to understand their needs and objectives. |

| Teams do not participate in key conversations and decisions. | Teams have a greater involvement in the discovery process, feeding into conversation at key moments. |

| Current ways of working do not enable team empowerment. | Team members feel empowered to take the initiative, make decisions and work in the way that's best for them. |

| The decision making process is slow due to unnecessary bureaucracy and hierarchy. | Decision making power is moved to where the knowledge is. |

| Teams run up against problems they alone can't solve. | Teams are supported by others who have time to focus on clearing the path ahead. |

| Team members are often moved between teams impacting delivery. | Team members are only moved between teams after careful consideration. |

## Problems you may recognise

**From:**

1. Our teams typically focus on delivering features or enhancements for an application or component. They are rarely involved in understanding business problems or objectives since this almost always happens 'upstream'. They are often not involved in exploring possible solutions which means that agile teams act as siloed "feature factories".

2. A lack of involvement in the discovery process means that teams do not participate in key conversations and decisions which results in the creation of sub-optimal solutions that are not joined up.

3. The current culture and ways of working are not conducive to team members feeling empowered, achieving a high degree of mastery or understanding the value of their contribution.

4. The decision making process is slow because it requires information to be passed up the organisational hierarchy, and requires decisions to be passed back down once they are made.

5. When faced with a problem, it is hard to find out whether an existing solution is available within Schroders. Where a problem hasn’t been solved it’s often because it requires a systemic solution that is beyond the remit of a single person or team. Getting the funding, sign off and prioritisation to tackle such a solution is very difficult meaning that these types of problems remain unsolved.

6. Our teams are typically long-lived, however team members are often moved between teams to accommodate growth or at the request of the business, and this can disrupt team dynamics and impact morale and delivery.

## Where we'd like to get to

**To:**

1. Our agile teams are aligned to our clients and customers and work with subject matter experts in the business to understand their needs and objectives. They are empowered to discover and deliver the best solutions by collaborating with others, testing hypotheses and gathering real-world data and insights - enabling the best ideas to come from the bottom up.

2. A close partnership with the business means that teams are able to input into key conversations and decisions leading to better, more joined up solutions.

3. Our culture and ways of working make team members feel empowered to take the initiative, make decisions and work in the way that's best for them. They are also able to take time out to learn and develop their skills, and they understand how the work they do contributes to the overall goals of our business.

4. Decision making power is moved to where the knowledge is, i.e., within the agile delivery teams, enabling the right decisions to be made quickly.

5. When a problem requires a systemic solution that’s beyond the remit of a single person or team, it’s straightforward to enlist the help of, or pass it to, a 'SWAT' team who have the mandate and funding to create the right solution. And when we take the time to solve a problem, we ensure others can discover it and benefit from it.

6. Team members are only moved between teams after careful consideration of the impact on team dynamics, morale and the fast flow of value, and after consultation with all those involved.

## Enabling stability and empowerment

Stable, empowered teams are simply more fun to be a part of:

- You believe in what you're doing, which leads to urgency and focus.

- You bond with your teammates and collaborate well.

- You trust and respect each other so that conflict becomes a creative rather than destructive influence.

- You and your team participate in making decisions.

- You and your teammates each help one another.

It’s simply more fun to be a part of the kind of team, that has optimism, enthusiasm and excitement, and a shared sense of camaraderie.

## Stability

The stable part of Stable, Empowered Teams is achieved by keeping teams together for the long term and not forcing team changes in response to short-term needs. When people are new to working together, all teams go through a natural process of bonding as a team. One fairly well-known way of describing the stages a team goes through is the [Tuckman model of 'forming, storming, norming and performing'](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newLDR_86.htm) which describes the stages of conflict and collaboration a team traverses in the pursuit of high performance.

Three big reasons why stable teams can make a huge difference to the performance:

- **Teams learn how to work most effectively together**: When they have worked together for a while, they will have learnt how to optimise their skills and working relationships, and will develop a real sense of team spirit because they actually care about each other.

- **Teams learn how to optimise their processes**: This process of continuous improvement helps a team to optimize its performance by eliminating, or at least minimizing, recurring issues that hinder the team's progress.

- **Teams learn how to predict their velocity**: With new teams, their pace can fluctuate wildly for a little while until it settles down. Knowing what they are capable of, helps established teams to plan more reliably.

Stable teams are such a valuable concept, it is best to align teams to specific products or product portfolios. That way they can move together from one initiative to the next without having to re-establish themselves as a team each time, and with the full benefit of already optimised relationships, processes, and velocity.

When the movement of people is necessary, it is done after careful consideration of factors such as the impact on team dynamics and morale, the opportunity cost, the impact on the delivery of value, etc., and after consultation with those involved.

## Empowered

An agile team includes all the necessary team members to make decisions, and make them on a timely basis. The team must be empowered to make decisions in order to ensure that it is their responsibility to deliver the work and that they have complete ownership. Any interference with the team is disruptive and reduces their motivation to deliver.

Research on employee engagement suggests that people perform better when they’re motivated and the traditional extrinsic motive, or 'carrot and stick' approach, is outdated and no longer works. In contrast, intrinsic motivation, when people are self-motivated because they’re given the freedom to do the work they enjoy, does deliver results.

The importance of autonomy, along with mastery and purpose, was highlighted in the book *Drive* by Daniel Pink. This book pulled together a great deal of research on what motivates people at work, and what drives them to want to excel at what they do. We see these ideas as key to enabling our teams to be empowered.

### Autonomy

Being autonomous and self-managing means collaborating as a team to decide who does what, when, and how, and involving all team members in events such as Sprint Planning. There are no sub-teams or hierarchies. They are a cohesive unit of professionals working from a single product backlog and focused on achieving the product goal.

A high degree of autonomy, whether at a personal level or at a team level, is vital to becoming invested in the problems we are trying to solve. Here autonomy means arming people and our teams with all the information to make decisions whilst operating within clearly defined boundaries.

### Mastery

Mastery is about a desire to continuously improve, advance, and exercise your skill set. This helps to ensure solutions are of the highest quality, there is a strong link between mastery, craftsmanship, and pride in your work. As such, our teams need to be able to take sufficient time out to learn and develop and have the space to innovate. This was referenced by Peter Harrison recently when he said:

**_"The best ideas to come from the bottom up."_**

### Purpose

People may become disengaged and demotivated at work if they don’t understand or can’t invest in the 'bigger picture'. Purpose is a tangible element of vision that motivates people to apply their talents and to overcome setbacks. Having a strong connection to the work we are doing typically delivers faster, better, and more effective results, while also enhancing engagement and accountability.

## Empowerment and Leadership

A lack of understanding and support from leaders can undermine the concept of empowerment — giving control without enabling people is frustrating, as is giving the idea of control whilst removing agency at every decision point.

As a leader, be aware of the levels of control, competence, and clarity you provide for your teams so that you can help them be effective. Understand that each variable is on a spectrum, and your team will feel differently depending on how those variables are set.

- **Control**: How much control your team has over what they do

- **Competence**: How capable your team is with being able to do their work successfully/efficiently

- **Clarity**: How well your team understands what they are trying to achieve

[For more on this idea check out this article from Geoff Mazeroff, inspired by David Marquet](https://geoffmazeroff.com/2017/10/23/control-competence-and-clarity/)

Google, through its Project Oxygen study, found that managers empower their teams by giving them opportunities to stretch and grow in four ways. These managers:

- Do not micromanage and delegate work while supporting team members who take initiative on new ideas.

- Balance giving freedom with being available for advice, such as knowing when to step in and offer advice to not pursue a failing issue.

- Make it clear they trust their team by giving team members the authority to make decisions without constant check-ins.

- Advocate for the team in the wider organisation.

The most effective managers usually realise that they work for their teams and not the other way around. [Read more about this on the Google Rework site.](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/managers-empower-your-team/steps/introduction/)
