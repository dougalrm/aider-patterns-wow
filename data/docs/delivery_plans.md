description: Delivery plans coordinate and communicate the expected delivery of features within agile product development. They align with roadmaps to clarify feature sequencing, identify risks and dependencies, and update progress. While fostering stakeholder engagement, they differentiate from tracking value metrics, evolving alongside regular team events. Suitable for managing expectations and refining strategies, delivery plans guide iterations and promote meticulous stakeholder communication.

# Delivery Plans - Communicating the Expected Approach and Timeline (CDF)

 (opens new browser tab)

*We've provided a link at the bottom of this article to a PDF version of a presentation deck which also covers this topic.*

## Delivery Plans

**Delivery Plans** can be used to coordinate and communicate the expected delivery of features. They facilitate discussions on capacity and sequencing, providing clarity and confidence. They also help to identify and manage dependencies, risks, and issues, and help to communicate progress to stakeholders. However, they are not designed to track value or serve as project plans.

### Key Highlights

- **Owned By**: The Delivery Plan is owned by the delivery team. The Delivery Lead or equivalent* is accountable for its creation and updates. The Roadmap in comparison is owned by the Product Family.

- **Update Frequency**: The Delivery Plan is a living document and should be updated as part of team's regular events (refinement and planning) and team leader/domain leadership discussion sessions.

- **Review Frequency**: Delivery Plans are reviewed regularly by team and domain leaders.

- **Time Horizon**: A Delivery Plan should cover a rolling period of time and are aligned to outcomes in the NOW horizon on the roadmap. A Delivery Plan becomes increasingly less accurate the further into the future it projects.

- **Contains**: A Delivery Plan is made up of features that are aligned to an outcome. An outcome can be worked on by multiple delivery teams. However ideally, a feature should only be worked on by one delivery team.

- **Accessibility**: The Delivery Plan should be saved in a central place and accessible to anyone at Schroders.

*\*The equivalent role may be one in the delivery family (i.e. the role responsible for a team or group of teams' delivery, such as a Head of Delivery) or an appropriate team lead.*

## Roadmaps and Delivery Plans (Outcomes and Outputs)

An **Outcome** describes the impact we wish to have on our customers, focusing on the value or benefit to the customer. An **Output** describes a specific, tangible product, service, or solution created as a result of work or effort.

### Where do Delivery Plans fit in?

We start with a vision statement that describes the aspirational and inspirational future state. Our plan to achieve this state is articulated in the roadmap and delivery plan.

Roadmap: The **roadmap** provides a high-level view of the **outcomes** that will be undertaken in the portfolio/area of focus. It is owned by the Product Family.

Delivery Plan: The **delivery plan** provides a detailed view of the specific **features** that are expected to be delivered to try and achieve an outcome. It is owned by the Delivery Family.

### Roadmap Outcomes Link to Delivery of Features

- Against each outcome on the roadmap, a set of features can be defined that deliver slices of value against that outcome.

- Features are then mapped onto a delivery plan.

- Delivery plans can be shown 'by team', 'by outcome', or by a 'group of teams' aligned to an outcome/s.

## Delivery Plan Example (Single Team, Multiple Outcomes)

FROM ROADMAP TO DELIVERY PLAN TO ITERATION

The images below describe when features should start to be generated and how a Delivery Plan should be revised. It relates the Delivery Plan activities to Roadmap and Iteration activities, providing a model for how they fit together.

### In the "Next" portion of the Outcome Roadmap:

- Possible ideas for features or solutions to be generated in little detail, providing seed for discussions.

### In the "Now" portion of the Outcome Roadmap:

- Feature ideas are reviewed, generated, and assessed.

- Features are prioritised and then estimated. NB: Estimation may trigger a re-prioritisation.

- Features are incorporated into a Delivery Plan.

## Outcomes to Features

A Delivery Plan consists of **features** aligned to an outcome. During the refinement of an outcome, potential ideas (opportunities or solutions) are identified and prioritised based on the expected impact on the outcome. These potential ideas, when refined further, are called features. Each feature represents a slice of value, incrementally advancing us towards satisfying the customer's need.

### Mapping Features onto the Delivery Plan

Features are mapped onto the Delivery Plan. This assists in coordinating and communicating the expected delivery of features and facilitates dependency and capacity conversations.

### Example

In this example:

- Features 1.4 and 1.1 have been prioritised and planned with high confidence.

- Features 1.3 and 1.5 have been scheduled but might change significantly as they will be refined further, indicating a lower confidence level in their delivery.

## Outcomes to Features -- Two Examples

### A Simple Example

**Outcome**: Improve the happiness of the children

**Success Metric**: Increase happiness by +2 rating

**Possible Features:**

- Feature 1.1: Make a Cake

- Feature 1.2: Take children to the playground

- Feature 1.3: Run an Arts and Craft session with the children

**Prioritise Features:**

1. Feature 1.3: Run an Arts and Craft session - Prioritised for development.

2. Feature 1.2: Take children to the playground - Consider later; has dependencies.

3. Feature 1.1: Make a Cake - Bin; requirements not feasible currently.

### A Schroders Example

**Outcome**: Client Service teams can navigate to information needed to efficiently fulfill client requirements

**Success Metric**: Decrease time spent on requests by 20%. Increase Client Satisfaction Score by +2.

**Possible Features:**

- Feature 1.1: Add "service x" to the centralised management system

- Feature 1.2: Implement regular training sessions

- Feature 1.3: Implement AI-powered search tool

**Prioritise Features:**

1. Feature 1.2: Regular training sessions - Prioritised for development.

2. Feature 1.1: Add "service x" - Prioritised for development.

3. Feature 1.3: AI-powered search tool - Consider later; needs reshaping.

## Understanding the Impact of a Feature

Understanding each feature's influence on specific success metrics is vital. This knowledge allows us to assess its effect on the outcome and prioritise future feature deliveries. If the team has sufficient capacity and capabilities, Features 1 and 3 can be delivered concurrently. It's recommended to evaluate Feature 1's impact on Success Metric 2 before initiating Feature 2's delivery, potentially altering priorities based on results.

## Building a Delivery Plan

The Product Lead* presents an outcome and initial ideas to the team, serving as a foundation for idea development. Ideas are shaped into structured, bounded features representing slices of value. Features are estimated in terms of effort, aim, and success measures, providing a structure to further develop evaluation and breakdown into stories.

*During this process, features can begin to be plotted onto the team's Delivery Plan.* (\* Or the person in the team with this responsibility)

### High-level Refinement Process

Identify an Outcome to be refined, which belongs to the Now or Next column of the roadmap.

#### The Refinement Process:

1. **Idea Generation**: Collaboratively generate a range of ideas aimed at achieving the outcome.

2. **Evaluate Ideas**: Evaluate each idea's feasibility and value, transforming valid ideas into features.

3. **Prioritise Features**: Evaluate and prioritise features based on impact, feasibility, alignment, and development cost/effort.

4. **Feature Estimation and Scheduling**: Estimate and schedule prioritised features on the delivery plan.

5. **From Features to User Stories (PBIs)**: Break down features into actionable PBIs, refining estimates and updating the delivery plan as necessary.

This process is iterative and dynamic, adapting ideas based on feedback and changing needs.

## Conceptual Example: Delivery Plan by Team

Your delivery plan might look like this, aligning features to an outcome sequenced by priority and capacity, providing a delivery timeframe expectation.

*Note: The further into the future you project, the less certainty there is.*

## Conceptual Example: Delivery Plan by Group of Teams

Your delivery plan might look like this, aligning features to an outcome but delivered by multiple teams, sequenced by priority and capacity, providing a delivery timeframe expectation.

*Note: The further into the future you project, the less certainty there is.*

## How Should I Capture My Delivery Plan?

To ensure easy accessibility for all Schroders employees, it's recommended to save the Delivery Plan centrally. Azure DevOps Services (ADO) is the preferred option as the team's work is stored there. ADO EPICS should be used for outcomes, and ADO FEATURES for features.

### Recommendations:

- Do not use "Feature Timeline" in ADO as it's deprecated; use the "Delivery Plan."

- Filter Delivery Plans by Outcome or Team for a focused view.

## Delivery Plan Checklist

A delivery plan should facilitate discussions with stakeholders about feature deliveries, prompting meaningful conversations and providing answers to key questions:

### Reviewing and Maintaining the Delivery Plan

**WHAT**

- What features are the teams currently working on?

- What is the expected value or impact of each feature?

- Which outcome does each feature align with?

- What features are planned for the next 12 weeks, and why are they prioritised?

**WHEN**

- When is the expected start date for each feature?

- What is the estimated delivery timeline for each feature?

- How confident are we in these timelines, and what could affect them?

- What are the Risks, Assumptions, Issues, and Dependencies (RAIDs) associated with each feature's delivery?

**HOW**

- How are estimations for effort, aim, and success measures being calculated, validated, and refined?

- How is sequencing and capacity planning being handled compared to all other team work?

- How often is the delivery plan reviewed, and who participates in these reviews?

## The Big Picture - Tying it All Together

### Appendix

### Comprehensive Team Delivery Plan

A **Team Delivery Plan** represents all the work a team is doing, including features aligned to roadmap outcomes and work not contributing to roadmap outcomes (e.g., maintenance, minor enhancements). This non-roadmap work should be grouped as a placeholder outcome (e.g., 'Small Change Portfolio') and included in the delivery plan.

**Writing Features**

Features should include mandatory information, with optional information as beneficial. Details increase as features nears team readiness.

**Mandatory Elements:**

- Client/Customer: Identify the client/customer (e.g., Institutional Investor, Schroders Salesperson)

- Description: Focus on the need, not implementation, with product and technical details.

- Business Value: Understand the expected impact on the outcome based on success metrics (e.g., revenue growth, satisfaction).

- Acceptance Criteria: Features must be testable with completion conditions, focusing on functionality.

**Optional Elements:**

- Value Released By: Indicate when value will be released (e.g., weeks from launch).

- Value Released How: Explain value release timing (gradual or all at once).

- Implementation Considerations: Outline steps for feature completion, understanding impact and effort.

*A feature should be deliverable within four to six weeks to adapt swiftly to changes, reducing waste.*

## Prioritising Features Based on Empirical Feedback

The right approach to feature development is crucial for impactful value delivery. Prioritising optionality and independence among features allows for informed decision-making and avoiding the 'feature factory' trap.

**Approach:**

- Features are independent value slices, each expected to influence a success metric.

- The team selects features by assessing their potential impact on success metrics.

- Post-feature release, feedback is gathered, and impact is measured.

- Decisions on future feature development are based on this information.

### Example

- An outcome has features A, B, C, X, and Y, each independently adding value to a success metric.

- The team assesses potential impacts and prioritises features X and C.

- After launch, team reviews data and assesses success metrics' impact.

- Based on new insights, features like A might be developed next to boost outcomes.
