# How We Structure Our Teams

The following page details what we currently believe is the right structure for teams within Global Technology (GT), and is aligned to one of our principles about [**building Stable, Empowered Teams**](cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/3eb8aeab-9c4f-4c9a-b0ab-8850f3cd0247.aspx).



## Team Structure

Typically, teams will have fewer than 10 people and consist of engineers supported by an Engineering Lead (EL), a Delivery Lead (DL), and a Product Lead (PL). We've used Engineers as a catchall term, which includes other full-time Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) such as Business Analysts, UI, UX, Data Modellers, Marketers, in addition to Software Engineers.

In some specific areas or situations, other team models exist.

*[Image caption: This image shows the makeup of a standard team highlighting the three leadership roles]*

Roles and responsibilities, job descriptions, and competency frameworks for each role can be found in the [**People section**](cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/e7263682-badb-499c-b285-0dcb66598a1a.aspx).

## Team Leadership

The Delivery Lead, Engineering Lead, and Product Lead roles are the leadership roles within a team. These roles are peers, with no one role having greater authority than the others. Briefly, they can be described as:

- **Delivery Leads (DL):** Support teams to develop good agile and lean practices, overcome challenges, and focus on continuous improvement while providing an appropriate level of delivery support. They are responsible for the 'Who' and 'When'.

- **Product Leads (PL):** Support teams by maintaining a laser focus on value, and by partnering with end-users to develop the product vision, strategy, and outcomes the team work on. They are responsible for the 'What', and in combination with the wider business, the 'Why'. More information can be found on our [**Product specific pages**](cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/a9784708-b2d8-46a5-8628-2c6cd132c763.aspx).

- **Engineering Leads (EL):** Support teams by providing technical clarity, guiding design and implementation, and mentoring and developing others. They are responsible within the Engineering team for the 'How'.

Each role brings a different perspective, and the byproduct of their close collaboration is a clearer description of a problem or need and a greater shared understanding within the team.

*[Image caption: This image shows the three leadership roles and their focus/responsibilities]*

It's important to note there is no 'one description fits all', and these three roles work together, sharing responsibilities to better achieve the organization's and team's objectives. This includes people management, product and delivery management, and technical and design knowledge to deliver the right product, the right way.

In addition to the individual responsibilities, the three roles collectively look after the team - maintaining a sustainable pace, allowing time for personal development and innovation, as well as elements of pastoral care.

Formal line management responsibilities will also lie with one of these three roles. Typically, this will be the person who is best placed to take on this role in addition to their other responsibilities. For more information on what this may involve, please see the [**Central HR guidance for colleagues**](KXM7uD9NbfFsiIViZExTBA/c2f0e6d4-cbc9-42c2-b077-2710fda0b7cc.aspx) and [**managers**](znwzrgdseashrzhgren3xw/c9bceca6-f689-4a88-b936-738497013ce9.aspx).
