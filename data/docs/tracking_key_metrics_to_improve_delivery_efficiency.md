# Tracking Key Metrics to Improve Delivery Efficiency (CDF Standard)



*This is one of the ways of working patterns that's defined as mandatory. That means that all teams in Global Technology (GT) must adhere to it.*

## Why Are We Focused on Metrics?

We are focused on metrics because when teams understand the flow, fitness, and quality of their work, they are able to gain valuable insights that help them improve. Metrics provide a shield to defend our right to practice our craft to the best of our ability. They also provide an enterprise signal -- alerting us all to organisational impediments that are holding us back.

There are many benefits to tracking metrics like cycle time, including improving efficiency, enabling data-driven decision making, and fostering a culture of continuous improvement. You can read more about why we care about metrics [here](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/AxES3qYq3pYZaIjkYGCfsA/27ec752f-b29e-4d63-b345-b217b913e7ba.aspx).

## What Metrics Are in Focus This Year?

In 2024, we are focused on **cycle time** and **defect ratio**, and these are the metrics that teams in GT must track.

These two metrics help us strike the right balance between speed and quality, and they're also used to report progress on our [2024 Key Result](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/YASyWyZ006UdMmjiDSgqSQ/f9f71e83-e0dd-43ab-b617-b0e6b615e601.aspx). The data is gathered and reported monthly, although teams that don't deploy code to production [are excluded from these aggregated figures](https://confluence.schroders.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=147900501).

## What We Expect From Teams

All delivery teams in Global Technology (GT) that are delivering change **must** track their cycle time and defect ratio.

Most teams already track these two key metrics as well as others they find valuable, and they should continue to use any that give them useful insights. Not all metrics will become enterprise signals, but they may still help teams to experiment and improve.

Teams are also expected to establish [ways of working that enable them to get accurate data from our metrics tools](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/AxES3qYq3pYZaIjkYGCfsA/e8a5b67a-2929-4bd0-901b-eeb7472b4379.aspx). They should then be using the insights from the new Team Metrics tool and Actionable Agile on a routine basis to understand their delivery performance and identify impediments to progress.

We're excited to see what improvements the adoption of AI can bring; however, we have already seen examples of teams making excellent progress in improving their cycle time. We've shared some of these on the [Success Stories](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/qUWG6ER2Zxtp9omT6Sqg/00b96f00-f338-45e9-9e1f-32b974c194c5.aspx) CDF page.

Of particular interest is the video about how [the ILS team reduced their cycle time from 40 days to 14 days](https://schroders.wistia.com/medias/1oublpvsbp) by identifying bottlenecks and improving flow.
