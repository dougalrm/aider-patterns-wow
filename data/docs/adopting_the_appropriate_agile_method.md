# Adopting the Appropriate Agile Method: Scrum vs Kanban





This page introduces two of the most common agile methods and is intended to help teams understand which method is most appropriate for them. It provides:

- An introduction to Scrum

- An introduction to Kanban

- A comparison between Scrum and Kanban

- Some advice on when and how to scale

## Choosing the Most Appropriate Agile Method

To choose between Scrum and Kanban it's necessary to understand the attributes of both and see how they relate to the type of work you do. This should be done in conjunction with the Enterprise Delivery Lead (EDL) in your area.

Broadly speaking, Scrum is more suited to complex, iterative work, like new product or feature development, while Kanban is more suited to continuous flow work such as support and service. This article explores this and should help you make a more informed decision.

## Scrum and Kanban

The two main agile methods — Scrum and Kanban — are briefly outlined below.

### Scrum

Scrum is a lightweight framework that was created to help teams and organizations solve complex problems and deliver value to their customers. It employs an iterative, incremental approach to enhance predictability, control risk, and create plenty of opportunities to learn and change course when difficulties arise.

Scrum is simple, well proven, and easy to understand. It brings with it the structure, roles, and events that teams need to become high performing. There are two important concepts at the heart of Scrum:

- [**Empiricism**](cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/388a414f-4b39-4a75-85ba-621264a4b949.aspx): Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and that decisions should be based on past experience.

- [**Lean thinking**](cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/388a414f-4b39-4a75-85ba-621264a4b949.aspx): Lean thinking is about reducing waste and focusing on the essentials.

The fundamental unit of Scrum is the small team of people known as the Scrum Team. Within a Scrum Team, there are no sub-teams or hierarchies. It is a cohesive unit of professionals who collectively have all the skills and expertise to do the work.

The diagram above provides a simplified overview of Scrum showing the Scrum team at the center.

In order for an agile team to maximize the benefit of the Scrum framework, it's important that they understand the empirical Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation.

#### Transparency

This means everyone having the same understanding of what the work is and the status of the work, and it means presenting the facts as they are with no positive reporting spin.

#### Inspection

This means being open and transparent so that the product, processes, people, practices, etc., can be reviewed. As an example, teams show the product to the customer at the end of each Sprint in order to gather valuable feedback and change direction as required.

#### Adaptation

This is about continuous improvement and the ability to adapt based on the results of the inspection.

*"It doesn't matter how good you are today, to be agile you must be better next month" — Mike Cohn.*

Scrum adheres to the underlying Agile principles of iterative, value-based incremental delivery by frequently gathering customer feedback and embracing change. However, the successful adoption and application of Scrum depends on great people who live by the five Scrum values, which are **Commitment, Focus, Openness, Respect, and Courage.**

More detail about Scrum and Scrum Theory can also be [**found in the Scrum Guide**](https://scrumguides.org/).

### Kanban

Kanban is a highly visual work management method that was developed in Japan in the late 1940s by engineers at Toyota. The word Kanban roughly translates in Japanese as "visual board" or a "sign," and it uses a Kanban board to visualize both the process (the workflow) and the actual work passing through it.

In the context of knowledge work, Kanban is an incremental and evolutionary approach to process and systems change. It is focused on getting things done and can be applied to virtually any type of work that follows a repeatable process.

#### The Two Types of Kanban Principles:

| **Change Management Principles** | **Service Delivery Principles** |

|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|

| Start with what you do now. | Focus on customer's needs and expectations. |

| Agree to pursue incremental, evolutionary change. | Manage the work, not the workers. |

| Encourage acts of leadership at all levels. | Regularly review the network of services. |

#### The Six Kanban Practices:

1. **Visualize the workflow**: Visualize work on a Kanban board which can be as simple as three columns — "To Do", "In Progress" and "Done". Use cards to represent the work and color-clouding to add meaning.

2. **Limit work in progress**: Set a limit on how much work (the number of cards) can be in progress at any one time in each column.

3. **Manage flow**: Teams should constantly look for any interruptions in flow and use these as opportunities for improvement. [**Tracking and analyzing metrics can help with this**](cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/4845e02e-dfaa-4cdf-88f8-a1fb4578b58a.aspx).

4. **Make process policies explicit**: The workflow process should be made clear using visible, well-defined work policies.

5. **Implement feedback loops**: For teams and companies that want to be more agile, implementing feedback loops is a mandatory step. Kanban suggests the use of feedback loops ("cadences") at a team level as well as service-oriented cadences.

6. **Improve collaboratively**: As with other agile methods, a key feature of Kanban is a mindset focused on improvement through evolutionary change.

Kanban has been shown to:

- Increase visibility of the flow.

- Improve delivery speed.

- Improve predictability.

- Improve dependencies management.

- Increase customer satisfaction.

- Provide greater alignment between goals and execution.

It's worth noting that many Scrum teams use a Kanban board to visualize their work; however, they are still following Scrum, not Kanban. [**This article provides more information about the theory of Kanban and advice for getting started**](https://kanbanize.com/kanban-resources/getting-started/).

The tables below compare the attributes of both methods in more detail.

### Work Cycle

| Scrum | Kanban |

|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| **Iterations.** Scrum has sprints within which the team follows the plan-do-check-act (PCDA) cycle. Complex, iterative work, like new product or feature development, may be better done with scrum. | **Continuous flow.** In a Kanban work cycle, as soon as one piece of work finishes, the team takes on another piece. Kanban is better for continuous flow work like support and services. |

### Work In Progress (WIP)

| Scrum | Kanban |

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| **WIP limits** are set by the Scrum team for every sprint, and new work is picked up only after all the work is completed. If teams need a sense of accomplishment, completion, or closure, they may be better off with Scrum. | **WIP limit** is ongoing. As soon as some work finishes, new work can be picked up. If teams keep working on one thing after another, Kanban may be best for them. |

### Inspect-Adapt (Empiricism)

| Scrum | Kanban |

|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Every sprint is an opportunity to inspect and adapt with teams holding a retrospective as part of each cycle to see what can be improved. If the work continuously evolves or the team is newly established, Scrum is likely a better choice. | In Kanban, there are Service Delivery Reviews, which also follow a regular cadence (typically weekly), however, they focus on process improvements. This means that as part of the Kanban method there is no deliberate focus on team development so teams need to consider this. |

### Transparency (Empiricism)

| Scrum | Kanban |

|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| In Scrum, both the process and the work must be visible to those performing the work and those receiving the work. Several artifacts and events are designed to provide this transparency, such as the Sprint Review. | The use of a Kanban board provides some transparency, as do the daily Kanban meetings to review the Kanban board. Kanban also has a Service Delivery Review, an Operations Review, a Risk Review, and a Strategy Review, each of which helps provide transparency. It's worth noting also, that a lot of teams use a product backlog in combination with Kanban boards. |

### Planning

| Scrum | Kanban |

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Scrum has specific events (sprint planning and the daily Scrum) for planning the sprint and the day. This helps teams tackle uncertainty and coordinate to work together effectively. | In Kanban, there is a Delivery Planning Meeting, but this meeting is about setting deadlines and deciding when to hand deliverables to customers. Kanban may be more suited to those responding to urgent, short-term requests, or changes. |

### Responsibility

| Scrum | Kanban |

|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| In Scrum, specific roles have clear responsibilities. For example, the Product Owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team, while the Scrum Master is accountable for the Scrum Team's effectiveness. If there's a need for clear responsibilities, then Scrum is a good choice. | There are two primary roles that can be implemented by teams practicing Kanban: the Service Delivery Manager (SDM), and the Service Request Manager (SRM). The Service Delivery Manager is dedicated to improving the efficiency of the workflow and has some similarities to the role of Scrum Master. The Service Request Manager has functions similar to those of the Product Owner and is responsible for understanding the clients' needs and expectations. |

### Stakeholder/Customer

| Scrum | Kanban |

|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Scrum has active stakeholder and customer involvement — at least once a sprint during a sprint review event. If the work is innovative, creative, or new and requires stakeholder and customer feedback and engagement, Scrum is likely the best choice. | In Kanban, there is less focus on stakeholder and customer feedback and engagement. However, the Service Delivery Meeting is used to check whether customer expectations have been met by the product delivered. |

In addition to considering the guidance above, another important consideration is the level of maturity your team is at. If you are just forming and about to work together for the first time, it is likely that you will benefit from following Scrum because it provides more structure and more people are familiar with how to use it effectively.

As teams mature in their ways of working, they may want to experiment to see what can help them improve further.
