# Anyone can Demonstrate Leadership Qualities

"Leadership is not a title or role. Itâ€™s a promise of a kind of experience. It says if I only have the power to influence these two people, I will wield that wisely and well."

\- John Amaechi

The experiences we have shape the person we become, no less so than on the journey to becoming a leader. As we begin to recognise the influence others have on us, it's important to remember that how you act and the behaviours you display will also influence others in turn.

At Schroders, we all have a role to play in championing consistent good practices and ways of working, creating a better working environment where we not only understand what we are working on but how everyone contributes to success both individually and collectively.

Adopting a leadership mindset gives everyone the opportunity to engage in a positive employee experience. A leadership mindset focuses on behaviours we can all demonstrate every day and doesn't just apply to those with the title or role of leader.

## Below you will find some of these behaviours and how you can apply each:

### Approachability

- Be accessible by being available to speak and listen to your colleagues.

- Show your colleagues how you come to a decision or point of view, not just what decisions you made.

- Understand that they may not always agree with you, but at least they know what to expect from you. An approachable leader is one who is reliable and consistent.

### Supportive

- Listen to your colleagues.

- Offer help when necessary and if appropriate.

- Accept that failure is part of a learning mindset and look for opportunities to identify what can be learned and how we can utilize the lessons in the future.

### Knowledge Sharing and Gaining Skills

- Share your knowledge and be open to learning.

- Acquire skills not only through formal training but also by working with others.

### Improving Collaboration

- Engage in opportunities to collaborate with your team and teams across Schroders.

- Be open-minded and curious, and when working with others, focus on improving, not proving.

### Trust

Being able to trust your colleagues is an essential part of what makes teams and organisations successful. Everyone needs to feel safe to speak up, ask questions, or make suggestions without fear of retribution or concern that their comments might damage their relationships or reputation.

- Fostering an environment of trust takes time and effort.

- Honouring your commitments, communicating effectively, listening, honesty, and providing respectful feedback are some ways you can build trust.

### Continuous Improvement

Striving to improve our processes enables us to work more effectively. This can be done at all levels, whether personal, team, or at Schroders as a whole. Helping to improve our ways of working is a fantastic way to contribute. As you look to improve the things around you, consider what checkpoints you can put in place to see if there is positive change.

### Feedback

Giving and receiving feedback is a skill that takes time to develop. We all want to be told when we are doing something well. However, accepting we have not done something so well can be more challenging. Asking for and welcoming feedback allows personal growth. Look for opportunities to make giving and receiving feedback commonplace.

Central HR has also produced guidance around feedback including a video featuring Peter Harrison on '[**The Power of Feedback** (opens new browser tab)](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/9gnxDq0wshct8hcJHaZKQ/c4143563-d964-4224-96a2-e268cc175cf2.aspx)' and how we can be better at giving and receiving feedback as colleagues.

### Visibility and Transparency

Visibility allows us to see. Transparency allows us to understand. We need both in the context of the work we are doing and the challenges we face. It allows for identification improvements and resolution of issues.
