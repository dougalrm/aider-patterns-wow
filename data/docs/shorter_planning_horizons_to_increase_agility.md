title: Shorter planning horizons to increase agility

description: Emphasizing flexibility and rapid feedback, shorter planning horizons enhance agility by enabling frequent delivery and quick adaptation to change. This approach boosts collaboration, productivity, and reduces risk, aligning with Agile values across frameworks like Scrum and SAFe. The key is balancing detailed planning with the adaptability needed for modern technology environments.

# Shorter Planning Horizons to Increase Agility

The core of agility is an [iterative and incremental approach](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/dc7c0b13-1a7a-4646-ab14-e41cf6792d17.aspx) to software development that emphasizes flexibility, rapid feedback, and frequent delivery of working software. One key way to achieve this is through shorter planning horizons, typically ranging from one to six weeks. Advantages of shorter planning horizons in Agile include:

1. **Increased flexibility**: Allows teams to adapt quickly to changes and feedback, avoiding costly delays and rework.

2. **Improved collaboration**: Encourages closer collaboration among team members, stakeholders, and customers for better communication and faster decision-making.

3. **Increased productivity**: Helps teams focus on small, achievable goals, maintaining momentum and avoiding procrastination.

4. **Reduced risk**: By delivering working software frequently, teams can get early feedback, reducing the risk of building the wrong product.

5. **Quicker time-to-market**: Allows teams to deliver working software quicker, reducing time-to-market for a competitive advantage.

Overall, shorter planning horizons increase flexibility, improve collaboration, increase productivity, reduce risk, and enable quicker time-to-market.

## Planning in Different Methodologies

### Planning in SAFe

Scaled agile frameworks like SAFe are designed to scale Agile practices within organizational structures. They use planning horizons, including portfolio, program, and team levels, to align work with business objectives and ensure coordinated execution.

#### The Pitfalls

SAFe assumes work is delivered through portfolios, programs, and projects. However, Global Technology is moving towards using Products, Platforms, and Services. Scaled frameworks can introduce rigid planning horizons, which might not be flexible enough.

To avoid long planning horizons, agile principles suggest an adaptive planning approach, allowing for flexibility and collaboration among teams and stakeholders.

## Five Levels of Planning

When using the Scrum framework, consider five levels of planning:

1. **Vision**: Overarching goal or direction for the product(s).

2. **Roadmap**: Outlines outcomes to achieve the vision.

3. **Delivery Plan**: Details specific features or components to be included.

4. **Sprint/Iteration Plan**: Lists tasks and activities for each sprint.

5. **Daily Plan**: Plans specific tasks for each day during the sprint.

### The Pitfalls

The cadence depends on work nature and market regularity. Scrum and CI/CD practices can overlap, but additional release planning becomes irrelevant if teams release value daily.

## A Note on Kanban

In Kanban, planning can be challenging due to unpredictable work. Scrum-ban combines Scrum's planning cycles with Kanban's work limits allowing adaptability.

## Finding the Most Flexible Approach Underpinned by Agile Values

Agile planning should provide enough clarity without excess upfront planning. Consider the constraints of planning just enough, timing it properly, and ensuring transparency.

Below is the cone of uncertainty illustration. When a product is uncertain (right side), a Product Vision guides development. As features become clearer, more detailed plans are required.

Agile principles suggest more frequent planning to allow for greater agility in responding to change.
