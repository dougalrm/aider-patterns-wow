# Outcomes Over Outputs

Outcomes mean the direct and indirect end results that occur after one has taken action. Outputs refer to what is directly produced by an action: for example, working software is the output of a programming task.

Outcomes require outputs, and both matter; but first deeply understanding our intended outcomes and remaining focused on them is important as it allows us to:

## Align to Business Strategy

- Emphasizing outcomes helps us align our efforts with the strategic goals and objectives of Schroders as a whole. It allows us to identify and prioritize the outcomes that have the most significant impact on the success of the product and the organization. By concentrating on outcomes aligned to strategic objectives and our strategy, we can be sure we are delivering value that directly contributes to the bottom line and drives business growth.

## Take a Customer-Centric Approach

- Focusing on outcomes means prioritizing the value delivered to customers. Instead of solely focusing on delivering outputs (features, functionalities, etc.), we shift our attention to the desired outcomes or results that customers want to achieve. This customer-centric approach ensures that we're building products that truly meet their needs and provide meaningful benefits.

## Improve User Satisfaction and Engagement

- By focusing on outcomes, we prioritize delivering value to users. This leads to higher user satisfaction and engagement. When users achieve their desired outcomes through our products, they are more likely to be invested and provide valuable feedback for further improvement.

## Be Flexible and Adaptable

- Concentrating on outcomes rather than predefined outputs provides flexibility, adaptability, and optionality. It allows us to pivot and adjust our approach based on changing circumstances, new insights, or emerging opportunities. This agility is crucial in a fast-paced and dynamic environment, enabling us to respond effectively to market changes and stay ahead of the competition.

## Continuously Improve

- When we focus on outcomes, we can easier adopt an iterative and learning mindset, seek feedback, measure the impact of the solutions, and make data-driven decisions to continuously improve and optimize aligned to the outcome. This iterative approach allows us to adapt and evolve based on customer needs and market dynamics, leading to better outcomes over time.
