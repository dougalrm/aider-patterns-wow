# Making Work Visible - Visualisation Tools and Techniques

Visualisation is a powerful tool for explaining complex concepts and promoting communication and collaboration. It allows teams to share a common understanding of data and radiate critical information about their work. This section explores various practices for visualising work and highlights the importance of visualising the flow of work from a strategic perspective.



## Transparency, Trust and Accountability

Good visualisation provides a common visual language that everyone involved can understand, regardless of their level of expertise. It allows people to see the business and strategic context, the work that needs to be done, the progress made, and any obstacles or distractions. This transparency and shared understanding foster trust and accountability within the team and with stakeholders.

Visualisation serves multiple purposes, including situational awareness, early issue detection, informed decision-making, and actionable insights. It also helps Agile teams see their work in a broader context, enabling them to prioritize effectively and make informed decisions. Visualisation plays a vital role in saying no to excessive work and maintaining focus on achievable goals.

The practices outlined below summarize and communicate the vast amount of information generated during the delivery of initiatives.

## Work Visualisation

### Task Boards

Kanban means signboard or billboard. In Agile, it is a tool for workflow visualisation, designed to bring clarity to work process and enhance efficiency by limiting work in progress. This creates a level of transparency, helping to quickly identify problematic work stages which can be improved to help teams work more efficiently.

- Scrum also utilises a Kanban to visualise work. It helps Teams make Sprint Backlog items visible. The board can take many physical and virtual forms, but it performs the same function regardless of how it looks. The board is updated by the Team and shows all items that need to be completed for the current Sprint.

- In both Kanban and Scrum, the [workflow](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/a0c57e41-50e0-481d-81f9-fc8686dba2f3.aspx) can be modified to provide added visibility.

- Choosing which [method](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/YASyWyZ006UdMmjiDSgqSQ/1afe113f-f808-4f9a-b97e-9b592e82d061.aspx) or framework is most appropriate for the type of work a team does is an important part of defining the team's ways of working.

### Work In Progress

- Work that hasn't been deployed, shipped, or otherwise delivered to a customer has no real value. Value is only realized when the work is available for use by the customer. The assumption is that the more work in progress there is, the more work will get to 'Done'. Yet, evidence is to the contrary. More work in progress results in less work done.

- The use of a Kanban board is a simple way to help limit Work in Progress by having a column that visually displays the work that exists in that state and setting a maximum limit on the quantity. The idea is that we shouldn't start new work before the existing work gets to done. Once a column has a WIP limit and the column fills up, then we're forced to move downstream to help get the most downstream work to truly done.

- Over time, teams often reduce their [WIP limit](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/8f28ec5a-7b86-4fbc-bdf4-9d61c142d1bf.aspx) to improve flow. Each reduction will challenge the team to cross-skill and collaborate more.

### Planned Work

Planned work refers to the work that we are aware of and will likely be included in the team's backlog. It can originate from various sources:

- Features derived from the Product [Roadmap](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/ZnItogF7IpiI2HA9asSMiA/4e2e7b9c-34de-41ac-9241-f02c2704d523.aspx)

- Defects

- Small changes

- Maintenance

- Refactoring

- Addressing technical debt

It is important to ensure that all types of planned work are balanced during an iteration. This will allow for teams to iteratively work across a number of areas.

### Unplanned Work

Unplanned work refers to work that we are unaware of:

- Incidents and the defects arising from them

- Business opportunities

- Unplanned maintenance

- Small changes

Opting for an agile approach means that the solution will evolve based on feedback loops and the increasing understanding of the problem. Change is inevitable in this process, with priorities shifting and stakeholders uncovering new needs while reevaluating the importance of previously identified ones.

Making unplanned work visible is an important indicator that there may be a way for the process or team to improve.

### Waste

The concept of "Waste" was initially coined in the manufacturing industry during the late 1940s.

- It was used by "Toyota" cars manufacturing company. During those days, manufacturing automobiles was a complicated process, making cars very expensive. Toyota had to find a way to reduce the price of cars and therefore started looking at their manufacturing costs.

- As part of this exercise, they started identifying "waste," which means the feature (or process step) that does not add any value to the customer. Once they identified the waste, they created ways to eliminate that waste from the system.

- Once they were able to identify the "waste," it was easy for them to come up with various ways to "eliminate" it from the system. Over a period of time, "Eliminate Waste" has become a fundamental concept of Lean.

### Sprint Goal

In Scrum, the Sprint Goal serves as the spotlight that provides transparency to what the team is working on and hopes to achieve for a given sprint. For the team, it provides a rallying point, focus, and cohesion.

### Work Hierarchy

Epics, Features, PBI's (Stories), when written clearly, articulate the outcomes and value to be delivered at different levels.

## Metrics Visualisation

### Burndown & Burnup

A burn-down chart shows the amount of work remaining over a number of iterations (the remaining effort), whereas a burn-up chart shows how much work has been completed and the total scope of a number of iterations.

### Cumulative Flow Diagram

A cumulative flow diagram is a data visualisation tool that works with a Kanban board. The horizontal axis represents a time period, and the vertical axis represents your team's items or tasks. The diagram accumulates every task from each column on a Kanban board and pulls it into the chart so you can see the following metrics:

- **Cycle time**: How long it takes a task to get through your process.

- **Throughput**: How much work the team delivers in a designated time.

- **Work in progress**: What the team is actively working on.

## Key Information

### Dashboards, (Incident/Performance/Deployments)

A dashboard is a way of displaying various types of visual data in one place. Usually, a dashboard is intended to convey different, but related information in an easy-to-digest form. Often, this includes things like key performance indicators (KPI)s or other important metrics that teams need to see and understand at a glance.

### DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA)

[DORA](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/4845e02e-dfaa-4cdf-88f8-a1fb4578b58a.aspx) metrics are a great way to measure and provide objective data on the effectiveness, efficiency, and reliability of team development and deployment practices, and help to identify areas for improvement for your team.

### Risks, Actions, Issues, Decisions

In the context of Agile methodologies and making work visible, Risks, Actions, Issues, and Decisions play crucial roles in fostering transparency, collaboration, and continuous improvement within the team.

By incorporating the Risks, Actions, Issues, and Decisions framework into Agile practices and making them visible, teams can enhance communication, coordination, and adaptability. This transparency allows team members to have a shared understanding of the project's or product's status, challenges, and progress, enabling them to make informed decisions, collaborate effectively, and deliver value iteratively.

## Prioritisation

[Prioritisation](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/f0544d50-aa38-48b6-ad70-ca51c12aa76c.aspx) is an essential part of working in an Agile environment. It enables teams to focus on delivering the most valuable and impactful work first. Making the process of prioritisation visible gives the team insight into why decisions have been made, helping them to keep the big picture in mind.

## Roadmap

A [roadmap](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/ZnItogF7IpiI2HA9asSMiA/4e2e7b9c-34de-41ac-9241-f02c2704d523.aspx) is a communication tool. It's a visual representation of your strategic plans.

- It provides direction to the team.

- It ensures teams are on the same page when it comes to product priorities.

- Allows for feedback and consensus so all team members and stakeholders can buy into the process.

- It looks at all areas of the product journey so any gaps can be identified.

- Roadmaps are living documents that should never be thought of as 'final.' In an agile environment, the more that the team learns, the more changes the roadmap will have throughout the product life cycle.

## Delivery Plan

[Delivery Plans](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/CIWsscu83QKHLo3NKRvg/530254f9-8222-4bb6-a35c-10b41f5dd835.aspx) can be used to coordinate and communicate the expected delivery of features. They facilitate discussions on capacity and sequencing, providing clarity and confidence. They also help to identify and manage dependencies, risks, and issues, and help to communicate progress to stakeholders. However, they are not designed to track value or serve as project plans.

## The Advantages of Good Visualisation Encompass:

- Enhanced communication.

- Improved collaboration.

- Promotion of transparency and trust.

- Facilitation of informed decision-making.

- Better understanding of positioning in relation to upstream and downstream systems.

- Early surfacing of information.

- Increased adaptability to changes.

- Clear understanding of the current state.

- Enhanced efficiency in working methods and team processes.

- Reduction of waste.

- Support for self-management within the team.

- Self-service capabilities to minimize unnecessary interruptions.

## Dysfunctions that Can Arise Include:

- Sensory overload: When there is an excessive amount of information, it can become noise, leading to people becoming numb and potentially missing important or critical details.

- Conflicting priorities: When different priorities clash, it can create confusion and hinder progress.

- Poor relationships: Misunderstandings, perpetuated assumptions, or stereotypes can lead to strained relationships within the team.

- Unmanaged risks or dependencies: Failure to address risks or dependencies can result in complications and delays.

- Overcommitment: Continually adding new tasks without completing existing work can result in a high workload and cognitive load.

- Avoidable distractions or "emergency" interruptions: Context switching due to unnecessary distractions can disrupt focus and productivity.
