title: What we mean by patterns

description: Discover the importance of 'Ways of Working' patterns. These patterns serve as practical, repeatable solutions to improve team practices and processes. Categorized into mandatory, highly recommended, and recommended, they guide teams in enhancing productivity and problem-solving across various domains like delivery, product, and engineering.

# What We Mean by Patterns

The Ways of Working patterns provide information about good practice or guide you in solving specific problems and are underpinned by [our five ways of working principles](cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/de10612a-0346-4267-83ec-cafb3e8a88d7.aspx).



In short, the pages below contain practices, methods, and processes that are recommended for adoption by each of our teams. Each pattern explains the expected benefits and provides practical guidance and approaches to solving common problems.

## What We Mean by Patterns

In the context of our ways of working, when we talk about patterns, we mean:

- A tried and tested approach.

- Something that's generally accepted as 'good practice'.

- A tool or practice that can be combined with other tools and practices.

- A general approach that is helpful in most contexts (but not necessarily every context).

- A repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem.

- Specific guidance on how to adopt and use an approach or tool to solve a problem.

## Why We Need Patterns

While there are no explicit instructions or published steps to increase agility, it is possible to identify certain recurring patterns that typically work to improve the practices, processes, and environment in which we work. These patterns reinforce the changes we need to make, making success more likely and speeding up progress.

The challenge is to ensure that each change introduces the most relevant patterns at the most opportune time, is not implemented for its own sake, but has a demonstrable effect upon outcomes.
