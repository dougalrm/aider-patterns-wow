# Continuous Improvement (CDF Principle)



Our five ways of working principles are:

- People & Collaboration

- Leading by Example

- Clear Business Outcomes

- Stable, Empowered Teams

- **Continuous Improvement**

Our principles are rooted in the agile values and principles. Here we take each principle in turn and explore what it means. It's worth remembering that these are aspirational concepts that describe the place we want to get to.

## Intro

The [**12th Agile Principle**](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) states:

"At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behaviour accordingly."

This is about making it a priority to stop and take a step back, to evaluate performance and identify room for improvement. And crucially, it's about doing so on a regular basis so that over time things get easier and better.

In short, if we're to succeed in [achieving our outcomes](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/YASyWyZ006UdMmjiDSgqSQ/481855c1-f699-480e-8805-cea97f7b0939.aspx), continuous improvement must become a habitual part of the way we work.

## Principle: Continuous Improvement

We value Continuous Improvement. This means:

- Improvement activities are rarely abandoned or scaled down due to delivery pressure or the complexity of the task.

- People have the courage and skills to provide constructive feedback and don’t wait until official performance reviews.

- All teams continuously strive to improve. Retrospectives are not routinely deprioritised, and they identify the root cause of issues.

- There is no tolerance for unnecessary friction or dysfunction.

- We can assess the impact of our ways of working.

## Where are we heading?

The 'From' statements below describe where some of us are today (you might recognize these), while the 'To' statements describe where we want to get to in the future, and it's the application of the continuous improvement principle that will help to get us there.

| **From** | **To** |

|----------|--------|

| Retrospectives are regularly dropped, shortened, or are ineffective. | All teams hold regular retrospectives—regularly taking the time to identify the root cause of problems. |

| Improvement activities are given reduced priority. | Improvements are prioritised alongside other work such that things improve over time. |

| Improvement activities are often abandoned or scaled down due to delivery pressures, allowing the status quo to persist. | Improvement activities are rarely abandoned or scaled down due to delivery pressure or the complexity of the task. |

| Leaders are unable or unwilling to help resolve blockers. | Leaders solve the systemic issues that cannot be addressed at the team level. |

| Innovation time is often used to finish work, and the improvement work that is done, is focused on technology. | Teams and individuals routinely take time to innovate and experiment to solve technical and business problems. |

| There is a general acceptance of friction and dysfunction, and sub-optimal has become the norm in many cases. | There is no tolerance for unnecessary friction or dysfunction. |

| Some people wait to give feedback and are reluctant to say how they really feel or aren't constructive. | People skilfully give and receive feedback, allowing them to develop and improve throughout the year. |

| Duplicate or out-of-date documentation lingers, causing confusion and waste. | Documentation is reviewed regularly and is removed or updated to ensure it’s as valuable as possible. |

| We lack the ability to assess the impact of our ways of working. | We can rigorously demonstrate the impact of our ways of working. |

Each of these points is expanded on below to give more insight.

## Problems you may recognise

### From

1. Team retrospectives are ineffective because they don’t focus on deeper systemic issues, are not informed by data, and/or do not adequately address root causes. They are also readily dropped when teams are under pressure, or are crammed into 30 minutes.

2. Product or Team Improvement activities are treated as separate or less important than the new development work.

3. Because of time/delivery pressures and the complexity of the environment, there is often a reluctance to persevere when things get difficult, so improvement activities are abandoned or scaled down.

4. Teams either do not raise issues and blockers to senior leaders to get their help, or leaders are unable/unwilling to help get them resolved.

5. Very often innovation sprints are not used to innovate and are instead used to finish off work. Most improvement work that is done is focused on technology, e.g., improving delivery pipelines, rather than working on business problems or opportunities.

6. There is a general acceptance of friction and dysfunction, for example due to poor tools, and therefore sub-optimal has become the norm in many aspects of the way we work.

7. People tend to wait for feedback until the official performance review process happens, and some people are reluctant to say how they really feel or lack the skills to provide constructive feedback.

8. Duplicate or out-of-date documentation lingers, e.g., on SharePoint and Confluence, causing confusion and waste.

9. We lack the ability to assess the impact our ways of working have.

### Where we'd like to get to

### To

1. All teams, including senior leaders, continuously strive to improve—holding regular retrospectives that focus on local and systemic issues. The time is taken to truly identify the root cause of problems and these events are not routinely deprioritised or rushed.

2. Improvement activities identified by teams are prioritised alongside other, regular activities such that over time they see incremental improvements in the work they do, and the practices, processes, tools, etc., they employ to carry out their work.

3. Improvement activities are rarely abandoned or scaled down due to delivery pressure or the complexity of the task.

4. Teams surface impediments to leaders who help solve the systemic issues that cannot be addressed at the team level.

5. Teams and individuals routinely take time to innovate, experimenting with new solutions to technical and business problems.

6. There is no tolerance for unnecessary friction or dysfunction, and sub-optimal tools and ways of working are tackled tirelessly until they are resolved. The attitude is "if it isn’t perfect, and it never will be, keep improving" and this is manifest in our approach.

7. People seek regular feedback from leaders and their teammates, allowing them to develop their skills and improve without the need for long, drawn-out performance review processes. They also have the courage and skills to provide constructive feedback to others.

8. Documentation is reviewed regularly and is removed or updated to ensure it’s as valuable as possible.

9. We can rigorously demonstrate the impact that changes to our ways of working have.

## Enabling Continuous Improvement

Ways of working are practices, processes, methods or events that we use to get things done. At the heart of agile methods is the philosophy of Kaizen, which comes from the Japanese word for "improvement". The philosophy is about making continual, incremental improvements to all aspects of life, and it involves everyone.

In some teams or organisations, the attitude is **"if it ain't broke, don't fix it"**, but you won't find that mentality in an agile team. The agile mindset is one that says, **"if it isn't perfect (and it never will be), keep improving"**.

This is exemplified by the boy scout rule to "Always leave the campground cleaner than you found it."

[**Retrospectives are a powerful practice that ensures teams have a regular opportunity to improve**](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/11323923-036e-4eb7-9d15-12856e7b2a0b.aspx), but a wide variety of practices can be utilised in the pursuit of continuous improvement.

A programme of continuous improvement is designed to empower employees to identify sources of friction, frustration or waste, and give them the time and resources to address the problems they find. When utilised on a consistent basis it's highly beneficial—improving collaboration, reducing waste, streamlining processes, increasing the effectiveness of teams, and so on.

Even small improvements can quickly build up incrementally and result in significant, measurable gains. This strategy is referred to by Dave Brailsford as "the aggregation of marginal gains". Hired as the performance director for the British cycling team, he implemented the philosophy of searching for a tiny margin of improvements and left no stone unturned.

He and his team tested different types of massage gels to see which one led to the fastest recovery, and determined the type of pillow and mattress that led to the best night's sleep for each rider. They even painted the inside of the team truck white, which helped them spot little bits of dust that would normally slip by unnoticed but could degrade the performance of the finely tuned bikes.

Within a few years, these changes transformed the British Cycling team, which has dominated the Olympic Games and the Tour de France. You can read more about this amazing story and the impact of marginal gains in the article [**This Coach Improved Every Tiny Thing by 1 Percent and Here's What Happened**](https://jamesclear.com/marginal-gains) or [**this short video from the London Business Forum**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQxYlu12ji8).

The diagram below shows the steps the continuous improvement cycle typically follows.

![Continuous Improvement Cycle](Continuous%20Improvement_media/media/image4.png)

The agile concept of inspect and adapt is central to the process of improvement. It refers to the deliberate examination by everyone in the team of all aspects of what they do, and the ability to respond and make changes based on what they find.

An example of this is that at the end of each iteration, a team will openly and transparently show the product to the customer in order to gather valuable feedback. And if the customer changes the requirements during inspection, the team does not complain but rather adapts by using this as an opportunity to collaborate with the customer to clarify the requirements and test out the new hypothesis.

## Continuous Improvement as a Habit

To enable continuous improvement at Schroders, it must be integrated into our ways of working. Not only should all teams, including leadership teams, hold regular retrospectives, but everything from client meetings to town halls should be followed by a deliberate opportunity to make things better.

Our default behaviour should be to ask: how can we do this better next time?

## Continuous Improvement and Leadership

Leaders play a vital role in ensuring continuous improvement becomes baked into the way we all work.

Perhaps above all else, leaders must ensure there is sufficient time and space for individuals and teams to innovate, experiment, solve problems, and improve what they do.

They also need to ensure this type of work happens at both a micro level (individuals and team), and a macro level (domains, divisions, and organisation-wide). This allows systemic problems to be addressed that cannot be solved at a team or domain level, but this work must be sponsored and championed, and again leaders have a role to play.

It's easy to give the impression that all this is about process improvement, but the reality is that effective ways of working are about people and the way they collaborate. People need the time and support to develop their skills and become more accomplished, and here again leaders play an important role. One aspect of this is the ability to skillfully give (and receive) timely and constructive feedback.

Continuous improvement challenges all of us to go beyond what we're used to and try out new things to reach higher standards and greater performance.
