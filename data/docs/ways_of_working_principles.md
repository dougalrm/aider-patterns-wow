# Ways of Working Principles (CDF)

Evolving the way we do things is easy to say, but often hard to do. The Common Delivery Framework (CDF) uses principles as one of the mechanisms to assist change.

## Our Ways of Working Principles

To achieve the outcomes of:

- Improved efficiency

- Earlier delivery of value to clients and staff

- Higher quality products and services

- Greater collaboration between the business divisions

We will have to make some significant changes to the way we work. We have developed five Ways of Working principles that should act as a sounding board, guiding the decisions we make as we pursue our objectives.

## Our Five Ways of Working Principles

1. [People and Collaboration](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/cd773991-6d1e-4926-b0c3-f76ef2eb8237.aspx)

2. [Leading by Example](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/671f032e-918e-4864-a9ce-17b0e06e61d5.aspx)

3. [Clear Business Outcomes](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/2f1e15e6-4110-44df-b678-6512f607945a.aspx)

4. [Stable, Empowered Teams](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/3eb8aeab-9c4f-4c9a-b0ab-8850f3cd0247.aspx)

5. [Continuous Improvement](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/d88bc27f-dd37-4d04-878e-c46efea9d098.aspx)

These principles are rooted in the agile [values](https://agilemanifesto.org/) and [principles](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html). Click on the links above to read more about each principle in detail, understand what we are trying to achieve, and see some of the patterns that you could implement to help solve problems you may have. A summary of each principle is also included further down this page.

## What We Mean By Principles

Principles can be described as things that:

- We believe in and value.

- Influence our behavior.

- Describe what 'good' looks like.

- Are aspirational in that they describe a future state.

- Describe the way we should work.

- Guide us and become habit forming.

- Serve as a 'sense-check' to ensure we are doing the 'right' thing.

- Are intended to be enduring.

- Apply in (almost) all contexts.

## Scope of the Principles

These principles are foundational building blocks. They can apply to any decision that impacts our colleagues, products, and services and can be applied by or to any individual, team, or area of our organization. In addition, the Principles can be used as a reference for us to better understand our responsibilities in achieving our outcomes. They should provide direction when assessing the effect our changes will have on our employees and the work we do. The initial focus is Global Technology (GT) and the people that interact with GT, however, a lot of the content described within the CDF principles can be applied to our wider organization.

## Why We Need Principles

To thrive in our fast-moving, ever-changing, digital world, it's imperative that we mature as an agile organization, and our five Ways of Working Principles are designed to help guide us as we do that. These principles provide a common understanding of what a better future may look like, and they can be applied in almost any context—no matter what you're doing or where you're doing it. They provide a way to sense check the decisions we make and can be applied when developing goals or objectives to help ensure we move in the same direction.

## Why We Chose These Principles

Our Ways of Working Principles emerged from numerous interviews, discussions, [retrospectives](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/11323923-036e-4eb7-9d15-12856e7b2a0b.aspx), surveys, etc., that aimed to explore the current state of the organization, with a specific focus on technology delivery. We eventually arrived at the five principles that should best aid the development of our agile ways of working. Over time, as we evolve our capability and improve, these principles will also need to evolve, but they've been chosen to help us overcome the main challenges we have here today in mid-2022.
