title: Recognising systemic impediments

description: This page explores systemic impediments in agile work environments, emphasizing the need for a holistic approach to problem-solving beyond individual teams. It discusses the importance of systems thinking, the Cynefin Framework, and value stream mapping to identify and tackle challenges for more effective product delivery.

# Recognising Systemic Impediments



One of our five ways of working principles is [**Continuous Improvement**](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/d88bc27f-dd37-4d04-878e-c46efea9d098.aspx). This is about regularly taking the time to identify sources of friction, frustration, and waste so that we can take steps to tackle them and improve what we do.

For an introduction to impediments, check out the pattern [**Recognising & tackling team-level impediments**](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/J2yM0atCqqk8E6VdblTQ/b7321862-7a74-40ed-85db-f048e751b21b.aspx) which covers the basics.

## A Different Type of Impediment

Systemic impediments are those with far-reaching effects that are beyond the remit or ability of a single team or domain to resolve. They are usually driven by external factors and require a change in the organization, which makes them far harder to tackle.

Picture the scene: Your team is regularly coming together to focus on improving how they work, but the same overarching problems seem to be the root cause every time. Worse still, these issues are perceived as being outside the direct control of your team. You might even recognize hearing frequent comments like "That's just the way things are around here," or "Well, that's a pain, but there's nothing we can do about it."

You're not alone. We can usually feel that systemic impediments exist, but it's hard to put our finger on exactly what they are or how they are contributing to our pain. As such, they require a different type of view, a holistic view of the landscape which requires a collection of people to fully understand the problem and then work together to identify the root cause.

## Really Moving the Needle

The consistent small improvements made by individual teams can add up, but it's tackling systemic impediments that impact multiple teams, domains, or even divisions that can really have a significant impact on our ability to deliver more efficiently and effectively.

We need to consider the delivery of products and services as an end-to-end system that starts with an idea and flows all the way through to a client or customer outcome. This way we can see how important it is to optimize beyond just the individuals, teams, and domains that develop the idea.

We need to think and look holistically at the entire system end-to-end, always keeping the valuable customer and client outcomes in mind.

By identifying and resolving systemic impediments we can expect to see the following:

- **Cultural changes**: that result in different behavior and language.

- **Strategic changes**: that improve important characteristics of the way we do things, increasing our effectiveness and efficiency in the medium to long term.

- **Tactical changes**: that are oriented around smaller, more immediate changes, improving our effectiveness and efficiency in the shorter term.

## Recognising and Identifying Systemic Impediments

As teams gain more understanding about agility and better ways of working, they can start to use these skills and experience to tackle more difficult problems.

Initially, it will be easier to solve [**team level impediments**](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/J2yM0atCqqk8E6VdblTQ/b7321862-7a74-40ed-85db-f048e751b21b.aspx), but soon the team will see that some impediments are caused by technical dependencies, are reliant on working with other teams, or are driven by adjacent processes outside the direct control of the team.

When dealing with systemic impediments, due to the complexity of our ecosystem, it's very hard for any one person to have a comprehensive understanding of the end-to-end system at work. We must therefore take steps to examine the system surrounding any impediment to gain insights into its inefficiencies and help us discover opportunities for improvement.

## Understanding the Issue

A common problem seen in many organizations is the tendency to focus on specific parts of the organization or a specific process, rather than seeing the whole. This failure often results in simplistic solutions being applied, usually in a cookie-cutter way, to what are complex adaptive problems.

In his book *The Fifth Discipline: The Art and Practice of the Learning Organization*, Peter Senge reveals that "when placed in the same system, people, however different, tend to produce similar results." Because of this, he recommends thinking systemically to get beyond the personalities and events and to examine the underlying structures which shape individual actions in an attempt to create the conditions where the desired type of events becomes more likely.

Due to the nature of these problems, there is no one way to understand the issue, and different techniques may reveal different views of what the root cause is. In this section, we cover several advanced techniques for exploring and understanding the impediment and its root cause in more depth.

## Going Beyond the Surface

**Systems Thinking** is an awareness of the role of structure in creating the conditions we experience. It helps to identify events and patterns of behavior and surface the underlying structures that drive those events and patterns. By understanding and changing structures that are not serving us well, including our own personal mental models and perceptions, we can create more satisfying, long-term solutions to problems and impediments.

**The Cynefin Framework** helps us to [**identify the true nature of the challenge or impediment**](https://schroders365eur.sharepoint.com/sites/myschroders/content/Pages/CorporatePages/cA5DcI8h54ye17yXUNla6w/b36805f8-cf48-47ce-a831-c885989289d1.aspx) we are facing. This understanding then enables us to choose the most appropriate and effective techniques for tackling them, which in turn, helps to ensure the best results.

**Value Stream Mapping** is a technique that helps analyze, design, and manage the flow of materials and information. By mapping out each step in a given process, you can see both the value-adding activities and those that generate waste, as well as the dependencies of each. Having such an overview allows you to remove the wasteful elements within your process and make the flow of work more efficient. It's important to note that not all activities that don't provide value are wasteful since they might be of significance for ensuring the successful delivery of a product or service (e.g., quality assurance).

## The Global Technology Enterprise Backlog of Impediments

When problems are encountered that are outside of the control of a single team or are cross-domain, they should be flagged to an Enterprise Delivery Lead (EDL) who will assist in understanding and taking it forward. Once the root of the problem(s) has been identified, it will be added to the Enterprise Backlog, which is our agreed way of prioritizing and resolving the more challenging issues we face as an organization.
