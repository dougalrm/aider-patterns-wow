# Agile Articles ‚ú®
A modern, zero-fuss publishing site for opinionated essays and guides ‚Äî not a knowledge base. Built with Express + EJS, powered by Markdown, styled with Tailwind (via CDN), and sprinkled with dark mode and tasteful motion.

## Quick start
Run locally with Node 18+.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000

Optional environment variables:
- PORT: change the server port (default 3000)
- CONTENT_DIR: where your Markdown lives (default ./data/docs)

```bash
CONTENT_DIR=./data/docs PORT=4000 npm run dev
```

---

## Add your first article
Create a Markdown file anywhere under your content directory (default: data/docs).

Example: data/docs/agile-mindset.md
```md

# The Agile Mindset

Agility starts with how you think, not the tools you use‚Ä¶
```

- Front matter fields:
  - title (required-ish: if omitted, the first H1 or filename becomes the title)
  - slug (optional: auto-derived from title if not provided)
  - date or publishedAt (optional, for sorting)
  - tags (array or comma-separated string)
  - summary/description/excerpt (optional, used on cards and meta description)
- Images: place alongside your .md and reference them relatively. They‚Äôre served from /content.
  - Example: ![Diagram](./imgs/flow.png) ‚Üí will be served under /content/<relative-path>

---

## What you get out of the box
- Home (/) shows:
  - Hero section with a clear CTA
  - Optional ‚ÄúFeatured‚Äù card (the most recent article)
  - ‚ÄúTrending tags‚Äù computed from your content
  - ‚ÄúLatest‚Äù grid of articles
- Article (/:slug) shows:
  - Title, date, reading time, tags
  - Rich Markdown rendering (GFM)
  - Copy-link button
  - Subtle reading progress bar
- Global:
  - Dark mode toggle with localStorage persistence
  - Good defaults for spacing, contrast, and motion

---

## Project structure
- app.js ‚Äî Express app and wiring
- routes/
  - home.js ‚Äî loads and renders homepage with featured/latest/trending
  - article.js ‚Äî loads an article by slug, computes reading time
- utils/
  - contentLoader.js ‚Äî scans Markdown files, parses front matter, renders HTML
- views/
  - layout.ejs ‚Äî shared layout, Tailwind setup, theme toggle
  - home.ejs ‚Äî hero, featured, trending tags, latest grid
  - article.ejs ‚Äî article header, content, progress bar
  - error.ejs ‚Äî friendly error page
- data/docs/ ‚Äî default content directory (you can change via CONTENT_DIR)
- public/ ‚Äî static assets (served at /)

---

## Theming and customization
- Brand color: change it in views/layout.ejs in the inline Tailwind config (brand.600/700).
- Logo ‚ÄúA‚Äù badge: update the markup in the header (views/layout.ejs).
- Meta description: set per page via description variable; otherwise falls back to a sensible default.
- Typography: Tailwind Typography plugin is enabled; prose classes are set in views/article.ejs.

Pro tip: For production, you can self-host Tailwind and purge CSS for optimal size. The CDN approach is great for simplicity and fast iteration.

---

## Content details
- GFM is enabled for tables and strikethrough.
- Heading IDs are generated by marked; internal links like [Jump](#section) work.
- contentLoader.js normalizes table blocks to avoid broken GitHub-style tables caused by stray blank lines.

---

## Accessibility notes
- Proper landmarks (header/nav/main/footer)
- Screen reader labels for controls (e.g., theme toggle)
- Keyboard-focusable interactive elements
- Color contrast tuned for light and dark modes

---

## Routes
- GET / ‚Äî homepage
- GET /:slug ‚Äî article page for a given slug
- Static:
  - /content ‚Üí serves assets from CONTENT_DIR (useful for images referenced by markdown)
  - /public ‚Üí static assets under ./public

---

## Deployment
Any Node-friendly platform (Render, Railway, Fly.io, Azure, etc.) works.

- Set Node version to >= 18
- Ensure CONTENT_DIR points to a directory that is present at runtime
  - If your platform has an ephemeral filesystem, commit your content to the repo or mount a persistent volume
- Start command:
```bash
npm start
```

---

## Roadmap ideas
- Search index (client or server)
- RSS feed / sitemap.xml
- Image optimization pipeline (thumbs, blur-up)
- Tag landing pages
- Reactions or lightweight comments
